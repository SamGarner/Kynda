News of the satiric order caught on and spread throughout the provinces. The rebels adopted a mock chivalric fashion: gray cloak (gray was the color associated with the poor), a begging bowl attached to the belt, and, as a topper, a flourishing “Turkish” moustache. Paintings, prints, and medals of handsomely dressed-down Beggars circulated. The look became a fad among young people.

The parallels are indeed striking. In both the Dutch and the American causes, people had to struggle to expand their identities from the local (Virginians and Hollanders to Americans and Netherlander). Both revolts had economic injustice at their heart. In each there was a foreign monarch whose behavior allowed for him to be easily demonized. And both had a founding father. The reasons for the similarities are fairly clear. Both countries came into being as a result of the unfolding of the concept of individual liberty. The differences between the two situations are partly explained by the two centuries separating them, in which, so to speak, society was able to integrate the longing for liberty.

Technically, it was the day that the city became Calvinist, but it might be more pertinent to say it was the day it became liberal. Ahead was staggering growth, a stock market, a harbor bristling with masts, streets filling with immigrants from all points of the compass. As the Dutch writer Geert Mak has it, “the 26th of May in the year 1578 is the exact moment when the real Amsterdam was born.” It is with striking but perhaps typical Dutch understatement that Amsterdammers to this day refer to the event, into which so much calamitous history had gone, as the Alteration.

The perception test is based on a simple subject-object relationship. If you are the subject able to observe objects around you, then you are not the objects you are observing. If you are looking at this book, then by definition, you are not this book. The only way to see planet Earth is from a vantage point outside it. Easy? The permanence test, on the other hand, relies on a simple question of continuity. If a quality or a description that you can associate with yourself changes while you otherwise remain unchanged, then that quality isn’t you. If you were once a teacher and now you are a writer, then those are changing states and neither is the permanent you.

I wish I could describe the real you to you in a way that your mind could comprehend, but unfortunately we’re not fitted with the right equipment to do that.

Then our mind is like a clear mirror, and everything we see or hear or smell or taste or touch or think is the truth. Then it is very easy to understand other people's minds. Their minds are reflected in my mind.

Won Hyo woke up and saw beside him what he had taken for a cup. It was a shattered skull, blood-caked and with shreds of flesh still stuck to the cheekbones. Strange insects crawled or floated on the surface of the filthy rain-water inside it. Won Hyo looked at the skull and felt a great wave of nausea. He opened his mouth. As soon as the vomit poured out, his mind opened and he understood. Last night, since he hadn't seen and hadn't thought, the water was delicious. This morning, seeing and thinking had made him vomit. Ah, he said to himself, thinking makes good and bad, life and death. It creates the whole universe. It is the universal master. And without thinking, there is no universe, no Buddha, no Dharma. All is one, and this one is empty.

He must also visit hell and save the people there, who are wallowing in their desires. Hell too is ‘like this.’ So tonight you will ride this wine straight to hell.” “But I've never broken a single Precept before,” Won Hyo said.

Long ago in China, the Sixth Patriarch once passed two monks who were arguing about a flag blowing in the wind. One monk said, “It is the flag that is moving.” The second monk said, “It is the wind that is moving.” The Sixth Patriarch said, “You are both wrong. It is not the flag, it is not the wind: it is your mind that is moving.” In the same way, with the leaves, wind, anger, etc., when your mind is moving, then actions appear. But when your mind is not moving, the truth is just like this. The falling of the leaves is the truth. The sweeping is the truth. The wind's blowing them away is the truth. The people's anger also is the truth. If your mind is moving, you can't understand the truth. You must first understand that form is emptiness, emptiness is form. Next, no form, no emptiness. Then you will understand that form is form, emptiness is emptiness. Then all these actions are the truth. And then you will find your true home. If

Many people are attached to name and form. They take this medicine and for five or ten hours it is the same as death. They have no hindrance from their body and their body's desires. It is like a dream. There is only the free action of their consciousness, the free play of the Karma I. So they understand that all life is empty. Life is death; death is life. They understand very clearly that fighting and differences among people are unnecessary, are just the result of wrong thinking. They no longer desire to be rich or successful. Rich or poor, success or failureit is all the same. It comes to the same thing when you are dead.” The first student said, “You've just convinced me to take special medicine twice a day!” Soen-sa said, “Taking it once or twice can be very helpful. But taking it more often is dangerous. It is very easy to become attached to special medicine. You are already a Zen student. So you already understand that life is empty; you understand what the true way is. When your body is sick, it is sometimes necessary to take a strong drug. But when you are healthy, you don't take drugs. So this special medicine cures some sickness, but it creates other sicknesses. After you take it, you have many attachments. You don't feel like working. You don't want to make money. You only want to relax or work in the garden or listen to music or enjoy art.” “Not make money? Heaven forbid!” “This is an attachment to natural-style or hippie-style living. It is no good for a Zen student. Many people take special medicine and understand themselves. But their understanding is only thinking. It is not attainment. True attainment of emptiness means that all thinking has been cut off. There are neither likes nor dislikes. Natural-style living is good. Plastic-style living is good. There are no attachments to anything.” The third student said, “Soen-sa-nim, many different people practice Zen. I practice Zen; businessmen and lawyers practice Zen. I have an attachment to natural-style; they have an attachment to big-business-style. You don't say to them that they must give up business and only practice Zen, and you don't say to me that I must give up natural-style and only practice Zen. It's just different karma, isn't it?” Soen-sa said, “Your life is natural-style; that's good. Businessman-style living is also good. What is important is why you are living this way. If you desire money for yourself or if you desire natural-style for yourselfthis is no good. If you cut off your desires, then business is not business. It is Bodhisattva business. Natural-style is not natural-style. It is Bodhisattva action. So you can use business or natural-style living to teach all people the true way.” “You can teach natural-style living?” “Yes, teaching natural-style is very good, as long as you are not attached to it. Natural-style is very high-class Bodhisattva action.” “Why?” “True hippies have no hindrance. If I have no money, that's okay. If I don't have a house or a bed, that's okay. I can sleep anywhere, I can eat any food. My whole life is freedom. I am free to do anything. Having no hindrance means not being attached to anything. So this hippie-mind is very good; it is a very high-class mind. But many young people are attached to hippie-style or natural-style living. This is no good. If you are attached, then hippie-style becomes a hindrance. You must cut off all thinking and all desires for yourself. Then you will soon attain enlightenment. The hippie-mind is only one hair's-breadth away from enlightenment. If a hippie could cut off his attachment to being a hippie, he would soon discover, ‘Oh, this is enlightenment!’ One of my first students in America had very long blond hair, which he wore in a pony-tail. One day I said to him, ‘I think it would be good if you cut your hair.’ He said, ‘No no, I like my hair the way it is.’ I said, ‘If you are attached to your hair, you cannot attain enlightenment.’ ‘Is this true?’ ‘Yah, enlightenment is complete freedom. If you are attached to your hair, then your hair is a hindrance. If you have a hindrance, you cannot attain enlightenment.’ ‘Okay, then I will cut my hair.’ ‘Fine. Now you don't need to cut it.’ So he learned that being a true hippie is having no attachments. Afterwards, he did hard training and soon understood.” The first student said, “Is it possible for a businessman to have no hindrance?” Soen-sa said, “Only if he has no desire. If he is working and earning money in order to help other people, then Zen is business, business is Zen. They are not two. All jobs are the same. Most people don't understand this. They are only interested in making a lot of money or becoming successful. This is small I. But if I make money to help all people, then business is good business. It is Big Business!”

“Systems” Versus “Goals” Scott helped me refocus, to use his language, on “systems” instead of “goals.” This involves choosing projects and habits that, even if they result in “failures” in the eyes of the outside world, give you transferable skills or relationships. In other words, you choose options that allow you to inevitably “succeed” over time, as you build assets that carry over to subsequent projects. Fundamentally, “systems” could be thought of as asking yourself, “What persistent skills or relationships can I develop?” versus “What short-term goal can I achieve?” The former has a potent snowball effect, while the latter is a binary pass/fail with no consolation prize. Scott writes about this extensively in his book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life. Here’s one real-world example: “When I first started blogging, my future wife often asked about what my goal was. The blogging seemed to double my workload while promising a 5% higher income that didn’t make any real difference in my life. It seemed a silly use of time. I tried explaining that blogging was a system, not a goal. But I never did a good job of it. I’ll try again here. “Writing is a skill that requires practice. So the first part of my system involves practicing on a regular basis. I didn’t know what I was practicing for, exactly, and that’s what makes it a system and not a goal. I was moving from a place with low odds (being an out-of-practice writer) to a place of good odds (a well-practiced writer with higher visibility). “The second part of my blogging system is a sort of R&D for writing. I write on a variety of topics and see which ones get the best response. I also write in different ‘voices.’ I have my humorously self-deprecating voice, my angry voice, my thoughtful voice, my analytical voice, my half-crazy voice, my offensive voice, and so on. Readers do a good job of telling me what works and what doesn’t. “When the Wall Street Journal took notice of my blog posts, they asked me to write some guest features. Thanks to all of my writing practice, and my knowledge of which topics got the best response, the guest articles were highly popular. Those articles weren’t big moneymakers either, but it all fit within my system of public practice. “My writing for the Wall Street Journal, along with my public practice on the blog, attracted the attention of book publishers, and that attention turned into a book deal. And the book deal generated speaking requests that are embarrassingly lucrative. So the payday for blogging eventually arrived, but I didn’t know in advance what path it would take. My blogging has kicked up dozens of business opportunities over the past years, so it could have taken any direction.” TF: My podcast was never intended to be a business. I was burned out after The 4-Hour Chef, which was nearly 700 pages, and I wanted a casual but creative break from big projects. Since I enjoyed being interviewed by Joe Rogan, Marc Maron, Nerdist, and other podcasting heavies, I decided to try long-form audio for six episodes. If I didn’t enjoy it after six, I would throw in the towel and walk. My rationale: Worst-case scenario, the experience would help me improve my interviewing, force me to refine my questions, and eliminate verbal tics, all of which would help later projects. One or two episodes wouldn’t give me sufficient practice for a hockey stick in the learning curve, so I somewhat arbitrarily chose six episodes as a test run. Roughly 200 episodes later, here we are.

One day [this woman in my class] said, ‘You’ve got to try this thing called affirmations. I read about it in a book, but I don’t remember the name of the book.’ So I can’t tell you here, because she didn’t tell me. And she said, ‘It works like this.’ “All you do is you pick a goal and you write it down 15 times a day in some specific sentence form, like ‘I, Scott Adams, will become an astronaut,’ for example. And you do that every day. Then it will seem as if the universe just starts spitting up opportunities. It will look to you like these are coincidences, and whether they are or not is less relevant than the fact that they seem to pop up.

Morning “Flooding”Listening to the Body Instead of the Mind To minimize decisions, Scott wakes up, pushes a button for coffee, and has the same breakfast every morning: a chocolatepeanut butter flavor Clif Builder’s 20-gram protein bar. The next step is exposing himself to new information to generate ideas for his comic strip: “There’s a process where once you clear your mind, you have to flood it. You may use different words for this, but I know you do it. So you empty it, and then you flood it with new input that’s not the old input. So I’m looking at the news, I’m looking at stuff I haven’t seen. I’m not looking at yesterday’s problem for the fifth time. I’m looking at a new problem, I’m thinking of a new idea. But then you’ve got to find out where in that flood is the little piece that’s worth working with. That’s where I use the body model. I kind of cycle through all this stuff. “The model is: Your brain can’t find good contact, not directly in an intellectual sense. Obviously, the brain’s involved, but what I mean is that as I’m thinking of these ideas and they’re flowing through my head, I’m monitoring my body; I’m not monitoring my mind. And when my body changes, I have something that other people are going to care about, too.” TF: B.J. Novak (page 378) has expressed something very similar. This bodily reactionan involuntary half-chuckle, a rush of adrenaline, a surge of endorphins, a sharp change of emotions, etc.can act as a metal detector for good material. It takes practice, but it works.

The Logic of the Double or Triple Threat On “career advice,” Scott has written the following, which is slightly trimmed for space here. This is effectively my mantra, and you’ll see why I bring it up: If you want an average, successful life, it doesn’t take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths: 1) Become the best at one specific thing. 2) Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things. The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility. Few people will ever play in the NBA or make a platinum album. I don’t recommend anyone even try. The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it. I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only one skill.

I’m here, I’m going to try my best, and I’m going to go home, and my family’s there. . . . Even though my whole world’s wrapped up in this, who cares?’” TF: The “and I’m going to go home, and my family’s there” is a line he adopted from Andre Agassi, one of his mentors. Shaun and I both love and recommend Andre’s autobiography, Open.

On Going Premium from Day One “The way that I hacked the system was setting my first hired, day-rate gig at several thousand dollars a day. I pushed myself to a point that was incredibly uncomfortable and required myself to deliver at the highest level. I charged accordingly because I had done the work, done the research, and knew what the top guys and gals were getting. I put myself in that caliber right away. . . . I set it at $2,000 to $2,500 a day. “They [the first contract prospect] said, ‘Okay, well it’s a six-day shoot.’ . . . In my head, I’m shitting myself doing the math. It’s more than I made last year, but I’m going to make it next week. They said, ‘That sounds fine. We may need to add an extra day. . . .’ “I said ‘I’ll get back to you on that’ [to play it cool], and I felt like I was going to go throw up in the bathroom. There were some stakes there . . . it was an indicator of where I wanted to go. I knew I wanted to be a top price point. I wanted to do less work, and do high-end stuff. Now, I don’t want to pretend I didn’t do a shitload. This is like a 10-year, overnight success program . . . I was eating, breathing, sleeping photography, [and then] when I was able to start to monetize my craft, I did so at a very high price point. Little note: If someone ever says ‘yes’ that quickly, you didn’t ask for enough.” TF: Chase and I share many philosophies, including this one. I didn’t accept advertisers for the podcast until I had 100K+ downloads per episode, as measured at the industry-standard 6 weeks post-publication. Why? Novice podcasters (which I was), bloggers, and artists of all types get too distracted in nascent stages with monetization. For podcasting: In the first 3 to 9 months, you should be honing your craft and putting out increasingly better work. “Good content is the best SEO,” as Robert Scoble originally told me. You have fundamentally two choices, and the majority of people choose Option A. Option A: You can waste 30 to 50% of your time persuading a few small sponsors to commit early, then stall at 30K downloads per episode because you’re neglecting the creative. Things are even worse if you get mired in the world of sketchy affiliate deals. Option B: You can play the long game, wait 6 to 12 months until you have a critical mass, then get to 300K downloads per episode and make more than 10 times per episode with much larger brands who can afford to scale with you as you grow. Haste makes waste. In this case, it can easily make the difference between $50K per year and more than $1 million per year.

I have recommended Kevin Kelly’s “1,000 True Fans” to literally millions of people. Many guests in this book have done the same. “If you only read one article on marketing, make it this one” is my common wording. Here’s a highly simplified synopsis: “Success” need not be complicated. Just start with making 1,000 people extremely, extremely happy. Kevin’s original piece has grown outdated in a few places, so he was kind enough to write up a newer summary of core concepts for readers of this book. Since I first read the original nearly 10 years ago, I’ve tested his concepts across dozens of businesses, many of which are now multi-billion-dollar companies. I’ve added some of my core learnings and recommendations at the end. Enter Kevin I first published this idea in 2008, when it was embryonic and ragged, and now, 8 years later, my original essay needs an updateby someone other than me. Here I’ll simply restate the core ideas, which I believe will be useful to anyone making things, or making things happen.KK To be a successful creator, you don’t need millions. You don’t need millions of dollars or millions of customers, clients, or fans. To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only 1,000 true fans. A true fan is defined as “a fan who will buy anything you produce.” These diehard fans will drive 200 miles to see you sing; they will buy the hardback and paperback and audio versions of your book; they will purchase your next figurine, sight unseen; they will pay for the “best-of” DVD version of your free YouTube channel; they will come to your chef’s table once a month; they will buy the superdeluxe reissued hi-res box set of your stuff even though they have the low-res version. They have a Google Alert set for your name; they bookmark the eBay page where your out-of-print editions show up; they come to your openings. They have you sign their copies; they buy the T-shirt, and the mug, and the hat; they can’t wait till you issue your next work. They are true fans. If you have roughly 1,000 fans like this (also known as superfans), you can make a livingif you are content to make a living, but not a fortune. Here’s how the math works. You need to meet two criteria: First, you have to create enough each year that you can earn, on average, $100 profit from each true fan. That is easier to do in some arts and businesses than others, but it is a good creative challenge in every area because it is always easier and better to give your existing customers more, than it is to find new fans. Second, you must have a direct relationship with your fans. That is, they must pay you directly. You get to keep all of their support, unlike the small percentage of their fees you might get from a music label, publisher, studio, retailer, or other intermediate. If you keep the full $100 from each true fan, then you need only 1,000 of them to earn $100K per year. That’s a living for most folks. 1,000 customers is a whole lot more feasible to aim for than a million fans. Millions of paying fans is just not a realistic goal to shoot for, especially when you are starting out. But 1,000 fans is doable. You might even be able to remember 1,000 names. If you added one new true fan per day, it’d only take a few years to gain 1,000. True fanship is doable. Pleasing a true fan is pleasurable and invigorating. It rewards the artist to remain true, to focus on the unique aspects of their work, the qualities that true fans appreciate. The number 1,000 is not absolute. Its significance is in its rough order of magnitude3 orders less than a million. The actual number has to be adjusted for each person. If you are able to only earn $50 per year per true fan, then you need 2,000. (Likewise, if you can sell $200 per year, you need only 500 true fans.) Or you may need only $75K per year to live on, so you adjust downward. Or if you are a duet, or have a partner, then you need to multiply by 2 to get 2,000 fans, etc. Another way to calculate the support of a true fan is to aim to get one day of their wages per year. Can you excite or please them sufficiently to earn what they make from one day’s labor? That’s a high bar, but not impossible for 1,000 people worldwide. And of course, not every fan will be super. While the support of 1,000 true fans may be sufficient for a living, for every single true fan, you might have 2 or 3 regular fans. Think of concentric circles with true fans at the center and a wider circle of regular fans around them. These regular fans may buy your creations occasionally, or may have bought only once. But their ordinary purchases expand your total income. Perhaps they bring in an additional 50%. Still, you want to focus on the superfans because the enthusiasm of true fans can increase the patronage of regular fans. True fans are not only the direct source of your income, but also your chief marketing force for the ordinary fans. Fans, customers, patrons have been around forever. What’s new here? A couple of things. While direct relationships with customers was the default mode in old times, the benefits of modern retailing meant that most creators in the last century did not have direct contact with consumers. Often even the publishers, studios, labels, and manufacturers did not have such crucial information as the names of their customers. For instance, despite being in business for hundreds of years, no New York book publisher knew the names of their core and dedicated readers. For previous creators, these intermediates (and there was often more than one) meant you need much larger audiences to have a success. With the advent of ubiquitous peer-to-peer communication and payment systemsalso known as the web todayeveryone has access to excellent tools that allow anyone to sell directly to anyone else in the world. So a creator in Bend, Oregon, can sell and deliver a song to someone in Kathmandu, Nepal, as easily as a New York record label (maybe even more easily). This new technology permits creators to maintain relationships so that the customer can become a fan, and so that the creator keeps the total amount of payment, which reduces the number of fans needed. This new ability for the creator to retain the full price is revolutionary, but a second technological innovation amplifies that power further. A fundamental virtue of a peer-to-peer network (like the web) is that the most obscure node is only one click away from the most popular node. In other words, the most obscure, under-selling book, song, or idea is only one click away from the best-selling book, song, or idea. Early in the rise of the web, the large aggregators of content and products, such as eBay, Amazon, Netflix, etc., noticed that the total sales of *all* the lowest-selling obscure items would equal, or in some cases exceed, the sales of the few best-selling items. Chris Anderson (my successor at Wired) named this effect “the Long Tail,” for the visually graphed shape of the sales distribution curve: a low, nearly interminable line of items selling only a few copies per year that form a long “tail” for the abrupt vertical beast of a few bestsellers. But the area of the tail was as big as the head. With that insight, the aggregators had great incentive to encourage audiences to click on the obscure items. They invented recommendation engines and other algorithms to channel attention to the rare creations in the long tail. Even web search companies like Google, Bing, and Baidu found it in their interests to reward searchers with the obscure because they could sell ads in the long tail as well. The result was that the most obscure became less obscure. If you live in any of the 2 million small towns on Earth, you might be the only one in your town to crave death metal music, or get turned on by whispering, or want a left-handed fishing reel. Before the web, you’d never have a way to satisfy that desire. You’d be alone in your fascination. But now, satisfaction is only one click away. Whatever your interests as a creator are, your 1,000 true fans are one click from you. As far as I can tell there is nothingno product, no idea, no desirewithout a fan base on the Internet. Everything made or thought of can interest at least one person in a millionit’s a low bar. Yet if even only one out of a million people were interested, that’s potentially 7,000 people on the planet. That means that any 1-in-a-million appeal can find 1,000 true fans. The trick is to practically find those fans, or, more accurately, to have them find you. One of the many new innovations serving the true fan creator is crowdfunding. Having your fans finance your next product is genius. Win-win all around. There are about 2,000 different crowdfunding platforms worldwide, many of them specializing in specific fields: raising money for science experiments, bands, or documentaries. Each has its own requirements and a different funding model, in addition to specialized interests. Some platforms require “all-or-nothing” funding goals; others permit partial funding; some raise money for completed projects; some, like Patreon, fund ongoing projects. Patreon supporters might fund a monthly magazine, or a video series, or an artist’s salary. The most famous and largest crowdfunder is Kickstarter, which has raised $2.5 billion for more than 100,000 projects. The average number of supporters for a successful Kickstarter project is 241 fundersfar less than 1,000. That means if you have 1,000 true fans, you can do a crowdfunding campaign, because by definition a true fan will become a Kickstarter funder. (Although the success of your campaign is dependent on what you ask of your fans). The truth is that cultivating 1,000 true fans is time-consuming, sometimes nerve-wracking, and not for everyone. Done well (and why not do it well?) it can become another full-time job. At best, it will be a consuming and challenging part-time task that requires ongoing skills. There are many creators who don’t want to deal with fans, and honestly should not. They should just paint, or sew, or make music, and hire someone else to deal with their superfans. If that is you, and you add someone to deal with fans, a helper will skew your formula, increasing the number of fans you need, but that might be the best mix. If you go that far, then why not “subcontract” out dealing with fans to the middle peoplethe labels and studios and publishers and retailers? If they work for you, fine, but remember, in most cases they would be even worse at this than you would. The mathematics of 1,000 true fans is not a binary choice. You don’t have to go this route to the exclusion of another. Many creators, including me, will use direct relations with superfans in addition to mainstream intermediaries. I have been published by several big-time New York publishers, I have self-published, and I have used Kickstarter to publish to my true fans. I chose each format depending on the content and my aim. But in every case, cultivating my true fans enriches the route I choose. The takeaway: 1,000 true fans is an alternative path to success other than stardom. Instead of trying to reach the narrow and unlikely peaks of platinum bestseller hits, blockbusters, and celebrity status, you can aim for direct connection with 1,000 true fans. On your way, no matter how many fans you actually succeed in gaining, you’ll be surrounded not by faddish infatuation, but by genuine and true appreciation. It’s a much saner destiny to hope for. And you are much more likely to actually arrive there. Some Thoughts from Tim Kevin distinguishes between “making a living” and “making a fortune,” which is an important starting point for the discussion. However, it’s worth noting that these aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive. Creating 1,000 true fans is also how you create massive hits, perennial mega-bestsellers, and worldwide fame (be careful what you wish for). Everything big starts small and focused (see Peter Thiel, page 232). 1,000 true fans is step #1, whether you want a $100K per year business or the next Uber. I’ve seen this with all of my fastest-growing and most successful startups. They start laser-focused on 100 to 1,000 people, niche-ing down as necessary with their messaging and targeting (demographically, geographically, etc.) to get to a manageable and cost-effectively reachable number. So, you may ask yourself, “Why aim for a mere $100K when I can try to build a billion-dollar business?” Two reasons: 1) Aiming for the latter from the outset often leads to neglecting the high-touch 1,000 true fans who act as your most powerful unpaid marketing force for “crossing the chasm” into the mainstream. If you don’t build that initial army, you’re likely to fail. 2) Do you really want to build and manage a big company? For most people, it’s not a fun experience; it’s an all-consuming taskmaster. There are certainly ace CEOs who thread the needle and enjoy this roller coaster, but they are outliers. Read Small Giants by Bo Burlingham for some fantastic examples of companies that choose to be the best rather than the biggest. And, as Kevin noted, the number of your true fans can actually be far fewer than 1,000. This is particularly true if you A) produce content that attracts a niche but well-heeled group, and then B) invite and look for indirect revenue opportunities not based on onsite transactions (e.g., paid speaking, investment opportunities, consulting). These can be far more lucrative than most advertising, tip jars, and the like. One reasonably common critique of “1,000 True Fans” comes from musicians, for instance, who say something along the lines of, “But I can only sell an album for $10, and I can only produce one per year. That’s only $10K and not enough to live on. ‘1,000 True Fans’ doesn’t work.” Scores of book writers have a similar argument, but it’s flawed. Remember, a true true fan will buy whatever you put out. If they refuse to purchase above $10, you haven’t done the work to find and cultivate real true fans. If you have true fans, it’s your responsibility to consider (and test) higher-priced, higher-value options outside of the $10 paradigm. Don’t be locked in the pricing model of the incumbents. In 2015, Wu-Tang Clan sold a single bespoke album at auctionin a handcrafted silver and nickel box made by British-Moroccan artist Yahyato one person for $2 million. There are a lot of options between $10 and $2 million. See my “free or ultra-premium” approach on page 290, which has provided me with complete creative and financial freedom.

I have recommended Kevin Kelly’s “1,000 True Fans” to literally millions of people. Many guests in this book have done the same. “If you only read one article on marketing, make it this one” is my common wording. Here’s a highly simplified synopsis: “Success” need not be complicated. Just start with making 1,000 people extremely, extremely happy. Kevin’s original piece has grown outdated in a few places, so he was kind enough to write up a newer summary of core concepts for readers of this book. Since I first read the original nearly 10 years ago, I’ve tested his concepts across dozens of businesses, many of which are now multi-billion-dollar companies. I’ve added some of my core learnings and recommendations at the end. Enter Kevin I first published this idea in 2008, when it was embryonic and ragged, and now, 8 years later, my original essay needs an updateby someone other than me. Here I’ll simply restate the core ideas, which I believe will be useful to anyone making things, or making things happen.KK To be a successful creator, you don’t need millions. You don’t need millions of dollars or millions of customers, clients, or fans. To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only 1,000 true fans. A true fan is defined as “a fan who will buy anything you produce.” These diehard fans will drive 200 miles to see you sing; they will buy the hardback and paperback and audio versions of your book; they will purchase your next figurine, sight unseen; they will pay for the “best-of” DVD version of your free YouTube channel; they will come to your chef’s table once a month; they will buy the superdeluxe reissued hi-res box set of your stuff even though they have the low-res version. They have a Google Alert set for your name; they bookmark the eBay page where your out-of-print editions show up; they come to your openings. They have you sign their copies; they buy the T-shirt, and the mug, and the hat; they can’t wait till you issue your next work. They are true fans. If you have roughly 1,000 fans like this (also known as superfans), you can make a livingif you are content to make a living, but not a fortune. Here’s how the math works. You need to meet two criteria: First, you have to create enough each year that you can earn, on average, $100 profit from each true fan. That is easier to do in some arts and businesses than others, but it is a good creative challenge in every area because it is always easier and better to give your existing customers more, than it is to find new fans. Second, you must have a direct relationship with your fans. That is, they must pay you directly. You get to keep all of their support, unlike the small percentage of their fees you might get from a music label, publisher, studio, retailer, or other intermediate. If you keep the full $100 from each true fan, then you need only 1,000 of them to earn $100K per year. That’s a living for most folks. 1,000 customers is a whole lot more feasible to aim for than a million fans. Millions of paying fans is just not a realistic goal to shoot for, especially when you are starting out. But 1,000 fans is doable. You might even be able to remember 1,000 names. If you added one new true fan per day, it’d only take a few years to gain 1,000. True fanship is doable. Pleasing a true fan is pleasurable and invigorating. It rewards the artist to remain true, to focus on the unique aspects of their work, the qualities that true fans appreciate. The number 1,000 is not absolute. Its significance is in its rough order of magnitude3 orders less than a million. The actual number has to be adjusted for each person. If you are able to only earn $50 per year per true fan, then you need 2,000. (Likewise, if you can sell $200 per year, you need only 500 true fans.) Or you may need only $75K per year to live on, so you adjust downward. Or if you are a duet, or have a partner, then you need to multiply by 2 to get 2,000 fans, etc. Another way to calculate the support of a true fan is to aim to get one day of their wages per year. Can you excite or please them sufficiently to earn what they make from one day’s labor? That’s a high bar, but not impossible for 1,000 people worldwide. And of course, not every fan will be super. While the support of 1,000 true fans may be sufficient for a living, for every single true fan, you might have 2 or 3 regular fans. Think of concentric circles with true fans at the center and a wider circle of regular fans around them. These regular fans may buy your creations occasionally, or may have bought only once. But their ordinary purchases expand your total income. Perhaps they bring in an additional 50%. Still, you want to focus on the superfans because the enthusiasm of true fans can increase the patronage of regular fans. True fans are not only the direct source of your income, but also your chief marketing force for the ordinary fans. Fans, customers, patrons have been around forever. What’s new here? A couple of things. While direct relationships with customers was the default mode in old times, the benefits of modern retailing meant that most creators in the last century did not have direct contact with consumers. Often even the publishers, studios, labels, and manufacturers did not have such crucial information as the names of their customers. For instance, despite being in business for hundreds of years, no New York book publisher knew the names of their core and dedicated readers. For previous creators, these intermediates (and there was often more than one) meant you need much larger audiences to have a success. With the advent of ubiquitous peer-to-peer communication and payment systemsalso known as the web todayeveryone has access to excellent tools that allow anyone to sell directly to anyone else in the world. So a creator in Bend, Oregon, can sell and deliver a song to someone in Kathmandu, Nepal, as easily as a New York record label (maybe even more easily). This new technology permits creators to maintain relationships so that the customer can become a fan, and so that the creator keeps the total amount of payment, which reduces the number of fans needed. This new ability for the creator to retain the full price is revolutionary, but a second technological innovation amplifies that power further. A fundamental virtue of a peer-to-peer network (like the web) is that the most obscure node is only one click away from the most popular node. In other words, the most obscure, under-selling book, song, or idea is only one click away from the best-selling book, song, or idea. Early in the rise of the web, the large aggregators of content and products, such as eBay, Amazon, Netflix, etc., noticed that the total sales of *all* the lowest-selling obscure items would equal, or in some cases exceed, the sales of the few best-selling items. Chris Anderson (my successor at Wired) named this effect “the Long Tail,” for the visually graphed shape of the sales distribution curve: a low, nearly interminable line of items selling only a few copies per year that form a long “tail” for the abrupt vertical beast of a few bestsellers. But the area of the tail was as big as the head. With that insight, the aggregators had great incentive to encourage audiences to click on the obscure items. They invented recommendation engines and other algorithms to channel attention to the rare creations in the long tail. Even web search companies like Google, Bing, and Baidu found it in their interests to reward searchers with the obscure because they could sell ads in the long tail as well. The result was that the most obscure became less obscure. If you live in any of the 2 million small towns on Earth, you might be the only one in your town to crave death metal music, or get turned on by whispering, or want a left-handed fishing reel. Before the web, you’d never have a way to satisfy that desire. You’d be alone in your fascination. But now, satisfaction is only one click away. Whatever your interests as a creator are, your 1,000 true fans are one click from you. As far as I can tell there is nothingno product, no idea, no desirewithout a fan base on the Internet. Everything made or thought of can interest at least one person in a millionit’s a low bar. Yet if even only one out of a million people were interested, that’s potentially 7,000 people on the planet. That means that any 1-in-a-million appeal can find 1,000 true fans. The trick is to practically find those fans, or, more accurately, to have them find you. One of the many new innovations serving the true fan creator is crowdfunding. Having your fans finance your next product is genius. Win-win all around. There are about 2,000 different crowdfunding platforms worldwide, many of them specializing in specific fields: raising money for science experiments, bands, or documentaries. Each has its own requirements and a different funding model, in addition to specialized interests. Some platforms require “all-or-nothing” funding goals; others permit partial funding; some raise money for completed projects; some, like Patreon, fund ongoing projects. Patreon supporters might fund a monthly magazine, or a video series, or an artist’s salary. The most famous and largest crowdfunder is Kickstarter, which has raised $2.5 billion for more than 100,000 projects. The average number of supporters for a successful Kickstarter project is 241 fundersfar less than 1,000. That means if you have 1,000 true fans, you can do a crowdfunding campaign, because by definition a true fan will become a Kickstarter funder. (Although the success of your campaign is dependent on what you ask of your fans). The truth is that cultivating 1,000 true fans is time-consuming, sometimes nerve-wracking, and not for everyone. Done well (and why not do it well?) it can become another full-time job. At best, it will be a consuming and challenging part-time task that requires ongoing skills. There are many creators who don’t want to deal with fans, and honestly should not. They should just paint, or sew, or make music, and hire someone else to deal with their superfans. If that is you, and you add someone to deal with fans, a helper will skew your formula, increasing the number of fans you need, but that might be the best mix. If you go that far, then why not “subcontract” out dealing with fans to the middle peoplethe labels and studios and publishers and retailers? If they work for you, fine, but remember, in most cases they would be even worse at this than you would. The mathematics of 1,000 true fans is not a binary choice. You don’t have to go this route to the exclusion of another. Many creators, including me, will use direct relations with superfans in addition to mainstream intermediaries. I have been published by several big-time New York publishers, I have self-published, and I have used Kickstarter to publish to my true fans. I chose each format depending on the content and my aim. But in every case, cultivating my true fans enriches the route I choose. The takeaway: 1,000 true fans is an alternative path to success other than stardom. Instead of trying to reach the narrow and unlikely peaks of platinum bestseller hits, blockbusters, and celebrity status, you can aim for direct connection with 1,000 true fans. On your way, no matter how many fans you actually succeed in gaining, you’ll be surrounded not by faddish infatuation, but by genuine and true appreciation. It’s a much saner destiny to hope for. And you are much more likely to actually arrive there. Some Thoughts from Tim Kevin distinguishes between “making a living” and “making a fortune,” which is an important starting point for the discussion. However, it’s worth noting that these aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive. Creating 1,000 true fans is also how you create massive hits, perennial mega-bestsellers, and worldwide fame (be careful what you wish for). Everything big starts small and focused (see Peter Thiel, page 232). 1,000 true fans is step #1, whether you want a $100K per year business or the next Uber. I’ve seen this with all of my fastest-growing and most successful startups. They start laser-focused on 100 to 1,000 people, niche-ing down as necessary with their messaging and targeting (demographically, geographically, etc.) to get to a manageable and cost-effectively reachable number. So, you may ask yourself, “Why aim for a mere $100K when I can try to build a billion-dollar business?” Two reasons: 1) Aiming for the latter from the outset often leads to neglecting the high-touch 1,000 true fans who act as your most powerful unpaid marketing force for “crossing the chasm” into the mainstream. If you don’t build that initial army, you’re likely to fail. 2) Do you really want to build and manage a big company? For most people, it’s not a fun experience; it’s an all-consuming taskmaster. There are certainly ace CEOs who thread the needle and enjoy this roller coaster, but they are outliers. Read Small Giants by Bo Burlingham for some fantastic examples of companies that choose to be the best rather than the biggest. And, as Kevin noted, the number of your true fans can actually be far fewer than 1,000. This is particularly true if you A) produce content that attracts a niche but well-heeled group, and then B) invite and look for indirect revenue opportunities not based on onsite transactions (e.g., paid speaking, investment opportunities, consulting). These can be far more lucrative than most advertising, tip jars, and the like.

In GeneralAsk the Dumb Question Everyone Else Is Afraid to Ask “Often, there’s a very basic, very dumb question at the center of a story that no one’s asking. One of the biggest stories I ever did, ‘The Giant Pool of Money,’ was predicated on just such a dumb question: ‘Why are the banks loaning money to people who can’t possibly pay it back?’ Asking the right dumb question is often the smartest thing you can do.” (Malcolm Gladwell also discusses this on page 573.)

a common attitude that transcends generations and societies. The angry, unappreciated genius is forced to do stuff she doesn’t like, for people she doesn’t respect, as she makes her way in the world. How dare they force me to grovel like this! The injustice! The waste! We see it in recent lawsuits, in which interns sue their employers for pay. We see kids more willing to live at home with their parents than to submit to something they’re “overqualified” to work for. We see it in an inability to meet anyone else on their terms, an unwillingness to take a step back in order to potentially take several steps forward. I will not let them get one over on me. I’d rather we both have nothing instead. It’s worth taking a look at the supposed indignities of “serving” someone else. Because in reality, not only is the apprentice model responsible for some of the greatest art in the history of the worldeveryone from Michelangelo to Leonardo da Vinci to Benjamin Franklin has been forced to navigate such a systembut if you’re going to be the big deal you think you are going to be, isn’t this a rather trivial, temporary imposition? When someone gets his first job or joins a new organization, he’s often given this advice: Make other people look good and you will do well. Keep your head down, they say, and serve your boss. Naturally, this is not what the kid who was chosen over all the other kids for the position wants to hear. It’s not what a Harvard grad expectsafter all, they got that degree precisely to avoid this supposed indignity. Let’s flip it around so it doesn’t seem so demeaning: It’s not about kissing ass. It’s not about making someone look good. It’s about providing the support so that others can be good. The better wording for the advice is this: Find canvases for other people to paint on. Be an anteambulo. Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself. When you are just starting out, we can be sure of a few fundamental realities: 1) You’re not nearly as good or as important as you think you are; 2) you have an attitude that needs to be readjusted; 3) most of what you think you know or most of what you learned in books or in school is out of date or wrong. There’s one fabulous way to work all of that out of your system: Attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful, subsume your identity into theirs, and move both forward simultaneously. It’s certainly more glamorous to pursue your own glorythough hardly as effective. Obeisance is the way forward. That’s the other effect of this attitude: It reduces your ego at a critical time in your career, letting you absorb everything you can without the obstructions that block others’ vision and progress. No one is endorsing sycophancy. Instead, it’s about seeing what goes on from the inside, and looking for opportunities for someone other than yourself. Remember that anteambulo means clearing the pathfinding the direction someone already intended to head and helping them pack, freeing them up to focus on their strengths. In fact, making things better rather than simply looking as if you are.

Be lesser, do more. Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them, something you could do for them? And you looked at it in a way that entirely benefited them and not you? The cumulative effect this would have over time would be profound: You’d learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. You’d develop a reputation for being indispensable. You’d have countless new relationships. You’d have an enormous bank of favors to call upon down the road. That’s what the canvas strategy is abouthelping yourself by helping others. Making a concerted effort to trade your short-term gratification for a longer-term payoff.

For me, the decision to invest in a startup comes after following a process that is heavily weighted towards EQ (emotional quotient). This process starts with exploring the idea emotionally. Should it pass that hurdle, I then do traditional due diligence, using objective data to validate the entrepreneurs’ assumptions around the quantifiable aspects of the business. So, how does one explore an idea emotionally? When evaluating a new product, I take the novel features (not every feature) and exhaustively play out how they might impact the emotions of the consumers who use them. After that, I take the same features and consider how they might evolve over time. Let’s take, for example, my notes around Twitter (which led to my investment in 2008). I was intrigued by a handful of novel features:

And the more we associate money with life, the more we convince ourselves that we’re too poor to buy our freedom.

a common attitude that transcends generations and societies. The angry, unappreciated genius is forced to do stuff she doesn’t like, for people she doesn’t respect, as she makes her way in the world. How dare they force me to grovel like this! The injustice! The waste! We see it in recent lawsuits, in which interns sue their employers for pay. We see kids more willing to live at home with their parents than to submit to something they’re “overqualified” to work for. We see it in an inability to meet anyone else on their terms, an unwillingness to take a step back in order to potentially take several steps forward. I will not let them get one over on me. I’d rather we both have nothing instead. It’s worth taking a look at the supposed indignities of “serving” someone else. Because in reality, not only is the apprentice model responsible for some of the greatest art in the history of the worldeveryone from Michelangelo to Leonardo da Vinci to Benjamin Franklin has been forced to navigate such a systembut if you’re going to be the big deal you think you are going to be, isn’t this a rather trivial, temporary imposition? When someone gets his first job or joins a new organization, he’s often given this advice: Make other people look good and you will do well. Keep your head down, they say, and serve your boss. Naturally, this is not what the kid who was chosen over all the other kids for the position wants to hear. It’s not what a Harvard grad expectsafter all, they got that degree precisely to avoid this supposed indignity. Let’s flip it around so it doesn’t seem so demeaning: It’s not about kissing ass. It’s not about making someone look good. It’s about providing the support so that others can be good. The better wording for the advice is this: Find canvases for other people to paint on. Be an anteambulo. Clear the path for the people above you and you will eventually create a path for yourself. When you are just starting out, we can be sure of a few fundamental realities: 1) You’re not nearly as good or as important as you think you are; 2) you have an attitude that needs to be readjusted; 3) most of what you think you know or most of what you learned in books or in school is out of date or wrong. There’s one fabulous way to work all of that out of your system: Attach yourself to people and organizations who are already successful, subsume your identity into theirs, and move both forward simultaneously. It’s certainly more glamorous to pursue your own glorythough hardly as effective. Obeisance is the way forward. That’s the other effect of this attitude: It reduces your ego at a critical time in your career, letting you absorb everything you can without the obstructions that block others’ vision and progress. No one is endorsing sycophancy. Instead, it’s about seeing what goes on from the inside, and looking for opportunities for someone other than yourself. Remember that anteambulo means clearing the pathfinding the direction someone already intended to head and helping them pack, freeing them up to focus on their strengths. In fact, making things better rather than simply looking as if you are.

Peter also poses the following three questions: “What did you want to do when you were a child, before anybody told you what you were supposed to do? What was it you wanted to become? What did you want to do more than anything else? “If Peter Diamandis or Tim Ferriss gave you $1 billion, how would you spend it besides the parties and the Ferraris and so forth? If I asked you to spend $1 billion improving the world, solving a problem, what would you pursue? “Where can you put yourself into an environment that gives maximum exposure to new ideas, problems, and people? Exposure to things that capture your ‘shower time’ [those things you can’t stop thinking about in the shower]?” [Peter recommends environments like Singularity University.] TF: Still struggling with a sense of purpose or mission?

I’ve applied this to early morning AcroYoga sessions, late-night gymnastics training, archery lessons, etc. Make commitments in a high-energy state so that you can’t back out when you’re in a low-energy state.

It can take B.J. hours of walking, reading newspapers over coffee, listening to music, etc., before he hits his stride and feels he can write, his zone generally occurring between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Says B.J., “I find that being in a good mood for creative work is worth the hours it takes to get in a good mood.” He added, “I read the book Daily Rituals, and I am demoralized by how many great people start their day very early.” For lifelong night owls like me, it’s nice to know that when you get started each day seems to matter less than learning how to get started consistently, however your crazy ass can manage it.

Are You Doing What You’re Uniquely Capable of, What You Feel Placed Here on Earth to Do? Can You Be Replaced? I remember a breakfast with Kamal Ravikant (the brother of Naval, page 546). Standing in a friend’s kitchen downing eggs, lox, and coffee, we spoke about our dreams, fears, obligations, and lives. Investing had become a big part of my net worth and my identity. Listing out the options I saw for my next big move, I asked him if I should raise a fund and become a full-time venture capitalist (VC), as I was already doing the work but trying to balance it with 5 to 10 other projects. He could sense my anxiety. It wasn’t a dream of mine; I simply felt I’d be stupid not to strike while the iron was hot. He thought very carefully in silence and then said: “I’ve been at events where people come up to you crying because they’ve lost 100-plus pounds on the Slow-Carb Diet. You will never have that impact as a VC. If you don’t invest in a company, they’ll just find another VC. You’re totally replaceable.” He paused again and ended with, “Please don’t stop writing.”

How Often Are You Saying “Hell, Yeah!”? Philosopher-programmer Derek Sivers (page 184) is one of my favorite people. His incisive thinking has always impressed me, and his “hell, yeah!” or “no” philosophy has become one of my favorite rules of thumb. From his blog: Those of you who often over-commit or feel too scattered may appreciate a new philosophy I’m trying: If I’m not saying “HELL YEAH!” about something, then I say no. Meaning: When deciding whether to commit to something, if I feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!”then my answer is no.

To become “successful,” you have to say “yes” to a lot of experiments. To learn what you’re best at, or what you’re most passionate about, you have to throw a lot against the wall. Once your life shifts from pitching outbound to defending against inbound, however, you have to ruthlessly say “no” as your default. Instead of throwing spears, you’re holding the shield.

Some words are so overused as to have become meaningless. If you find yourself using nebulous terms like “success,” “happiness,” or “investing,” it pays to explicitly define them or stop using them. Answering “What would it look like if I had ___ ?” helps clarify things. Life favors the specific ask and punishes the vague wish.

I do well with binary decisions. In other words, I do a ton of homework and commit to an investment that I cannot reverse. That “what’s done is done” aspect allows me to sleep well at night, as there is no buy-sell choice for the foreseeable future. I’m protected from my lesser, flip-flopping self. That has produced more than a few 10x to 100x ROI investments.

the typically bull-market-dependent VC world is investing in businesses like Uber, which A) have a lot of international exposure (like U.S. blue chips), and B) could be considered macroeconomically counter-cyclical. For instance, it’s conceivable a stock market correction or crash could simultaneously lead fewer people to buy cars and/or more people to sign up as Uber drivers to supplement or replace their jobs. Ditto with Airbnb and others that have more variable than fixed costs compared to incumbents (e.g., Hilton).

I’m a fan of funding ballsy founders (which includes women, such as Tracy DiNunzio, page 313), and I want many moonshots to be funded, but here’s the reality of my portfolio: As I’ve signed the investment docs for every big success I’ve had, I’ve always thought, “I will never lose money on this deal.” The “this will be a home run or nothing” deals usually end up at nothing. I’m not saying such deals can’t work, but I try not to specialize in them. These days, the real unicorns aren’t the media darlings with billion-dollar valuations. Those have become terrifyingly passé. The unicorns are the high-growth startups with a reasonable margin of safety.

If you’re suffering from a feeling of overwhelm, it might be useful to ask yourself two questions: In the midst of overwhelm, is life not showing me exactly what I should subtract? Am I having a breakdown or a breakthrough? As Marcus Aurelius and Ryan Holiday (page 334) would say, “The obstacle is the way.” This doesn’t mean seeing problems, accepting them, and leaving them to fester. Nor does it mean rationalizing problems into good things. To me, it means using pain to find clarity. If pain is examined and not ignored, it can show you what to excise from your life. For me, step one is always the same: Write down the 20% of activities and people causing 80% or more of your negative emotions. My step two is doing a “fear-setting” exercise on paper (page 463), in which I ask and answer, “What is really the worst that could happen if I stopped doing what I’m considering? And so what? How could I undo any damage?” Allow me to share a real-world example: a transcript of the journal page that convinced me to write this and kickstart an extended startup vacation. The questions in my mind were: “What is really the worst that could happen if I stopped angel investing for a minimum of 6 to 12 months? Do those worst-case scenarios really matter? How could I undo any potential damage? Could I do a 2-week test?” As you’ll notice, I made lists of the guaranteed upsides versus speculative downsides. If we define “risk” as I like tothe likelihood of an irreversible negative outcomewe can see how stupid (and unnecessarily painful) all my fretting and procrastination was. All I needed to do was put it on paper. Hit snooze 45 times, so up at ~10:15 instead of 8:33. The anxiety is mostly related to email and startups: new pitches, new intros, etc. Do a 2-week test where “no” to ALL cold intros and pitches? Why am I hesitant? For saying “no” to all: PROS: 100% guaranteed anxiety reduction Feeling of freedom Less indecision, less deliberation, far more bandwidth for CREATING, for READING, for PHYSICAL [TRAINING], for EXPERIMENTS CONS (i.e., why not?): Might find the next Uber (<10% chance) Who cares? Wouldn’t materialize for 79 years minimum. If Uber pops (IPO), it won’t matter. Not get more deals. But who cares? *Dinner with 5 friends fixes it. *One blog post [for sourcing from readers] fixes it. *NONE of my best deals (Shyp, Shopify, Uber, Twitter, Facebook, Alibaba, etc.) came from cold intros from acquaintances. If try 2 weeks, how to ensure successful: I don’t even see [new] startup emails. No con-calls. [Cite] “con-call vacation” → push to email or EOD [end-of-day review with assistant]. Offer [additional] “office hours” on Fridays [for existing portfolio]? I ultimately realized: If I set up policies to avoid new startups for 2 weeks, the systems will persist. I might as well make it semi-permanent and take a real “startup vacation.” Now it’s your turn: What do you need a vacation from?

The second you start doing it for an audience, you’ve lost the long game because creating something that is rewarding and sustainable over the long run requires, most of all, keeping yourself excited about it. . . . Trying to predict what [an audience will] be interested in and kind of pretzeling yourself to fit those expectations, you soon begin to begrudge it and become embitteredand it begins to show in the work.

If You Want to Be Tougher, Be Tougher “If you want to be tougher mentally, it is simple: Be tougher. Don’t meditate on it.” These words of Jocko’s helped one listenera drug addictget sober after many failed attempts. The simple logic struck a chord: “Being tougher” was, more than anything, a decision to be tougher. It’s possible to immediately “be tougher,” starting with your next decision. Have trouble saying “no” to dessert? Be tougher.

‘Hmmm . . . that’s what you need to do: step back and observe.’ I realized that detaching yourself from the situation, so you can see what’s happening, is absolutely critical. Now, when I talk to executives or mid-level managers, I explain to them that I’m doing that all the time. “It sounds horrible, but it’s almost like, sometimes, I’m not a participant in my own life. I’m an observer of that guy who’s doing it. So, if I’m having a conversation with you and we’re trying to discuss a point, I’m watching and saying [to myself], ‘Wait, am I being too emotional right now? Wait a second, look at him. What is his reaction?’ Because I’m not reading you correctly if I’m seeing you through my own emotion or ego. I can’t really see what you’re thinking if I’m emotional. But if I step out of that, now I can see the real you and assess if you are getting angry, or if your ego is getting hurt, or if you’re about to cave because you’re just fed up with me. Whereas, if I’m raging in my own head, I might miss all of that. So being able to detach as a leader is critical.”

His Message at a High School Commencement “You guys are programmed to succeed. The hardest thing you’re ever going to do in your life is fail at something, and if you don’t start failing at things, you will not live a full life. You’ll be living a cautious life on a path that you know is pretty much guaranteed to more or less work. That’s not getting the most out of this amazing world we live in. You have to do the hardest thing that you have not been prepared for in this school or any school: You have to be prepared to fail. That’s how you’re going to expand yourself and grow. As you work through that process of failure and learning, you will really deepen into the human being you’re capable of being.”

the tricky thing about life is, on the one hand having the courage to enter into things that are unfamiliar, but also having the wisdom to stop exploring when you’ve found something worth sticking around for. That is true of a place, of a person, of a vocation. Balancing those two thingsthe courage of exploring and the commitment to stayingand getting the ratio right is very hard. I think my 70-year-old self would say: ‘Be careful that you don’t err on one side or the other, because you have an ill-conceived idea of who you are.’”

Consider using the free, cross-platform tool VeraCrypt. If you feel you might ever be compelled to reveal a password for your computer such as at a border crossing or by “rubber hose” cryptanalysis (being beaten by a rubber hose until you squeal), you can use “hidden volumes” to hide data with two passwords, providing you plausible deniability. Such hidden volumes are encrypted disks or directories that have one password that decrypts to show various files that you placed and are comfortable with revealing, while a secondary password can decrypt the same folder containing the actual, confidential data you’re protecting, with no way to prove whether there’s a single password or two passwords for the volume.

A great amount of software will make outbound connections to the Internet, typically for legitimate purposes, though not necessarily. If you wish to prevent or at least learn when an application is doing this, you can use NetLimiter on Windows or Little Snitch on OS X to detect and decide to allow or block when a specific application is connecting out, and learn where it’s connecting to. You can use Wireshark for further analysis, mentioned below.

Tor is a free, cross-platform software that allows you to browse the Internet anonymously and helps you defend against network surveillance. It will help change your IP address each time you use it as well as encrypt your network communication, however the last “hop” in the chain of Tor will always be able to see your unencrypted traffic, though [it will] not be able to detect your IP address. I would trust Tor over any VPN service as no Tor node knows both your IP and what you’re accessing, unlike a VPN, which could be compelled to share that data.

If a website is delivering images, video, or audio to your computer, that means in most cases you can download it directly, even if the site attempts to stop you. In Chrome (similar tools exist in Firefox and Safari), you can go to View → Developer → Developer Tools, click on the Network tab, refresh the page, and see all content going across. You can then right-click any file, such as an image that the site wouldn’t otherwise let you download, and click Copy Link Address to get the direct URL. The Elements tab is also particularly useful. [TF: You can also use this to easily copy and paste good quotes that some sites like to prevent you from copy and pasting.]

Though I’m not a lawyer, using these tools on a network and devices you have reign over, such as your home LAN, will likely not carry any consequence. The only way to understand the security and insecurity of your own network is to test the same tools attackers would use. I highly suggest those interested in learning use theseboth the good guys and the bad guys are using these same exact tools! To learn about some of the starting tools a hacker, attacker, or someone just curious about security would use, I’d suggest looking at beginning tools such as Wireshark, Charles (web debugging proxy), NightHawk (ARP/ND spoofing and password sniffing), arpy (ARP spoofing), dsniff (password sniffing), and Kali Linux (penetration testing) and looking up tutorials on network intrusion, sniffing, and man-in-the-middling.

To further dive into security, I’d suggest learning to program. It’s easier than you think! Learning to program allows you to learn how someone might engineer something and helps you think about how you can then reverse that and exploit it, as if you had created it yourself.

On Creating a “Red Team” STAN: “The concept of ‘red team’ is designed to test a plan. What happens is, as you develop a planyou’ve got a problem and you develop a way to solve that problemyou fall in love with it. You start to dismiss the shortcomings of it, simply because, I think, that’s the way the mind works. . . . Sometimes you’re actually skipping over real challenges to it, or vulnerabilities in it, because you just want it to work. As we describe it, sometimes a plan can end up being a string of miracles, and that’s not a real solid plan. So red teaming is: You take people who aren’t wedded to the plan and [ask them,] ‘How would you disrupt this plan or how would you defeat this plan?’ If you have a very thoughtful red team, you’ll produce stunning results.”

After you feel the acute pain of your current handicapping beliefs, you formulate 2 to 3 replacement beliefs to use moving forward. This is done so that “you are not pulled back into [old beliefs] by old language patterns.” One of my top 3 limiting beliefs was “I’m not hardwired for happiness,” which I replaced with “Happiness is my natural state.” Post-event, I used Scott Adams’s (page 261) affirmation approach in the mornings to reinforce it. Now, I’m well aware how cheesy this all might sound on paper. Nonetheless, I experienced a huge phase shift in my life in the subsequent 3 to 4 weeks. Roughly a year later, I can say this: I’ve never felt consistently happier in my entire adult life.

“We’re so deeply conditioned to be lost in thought and to have this conversation with ourselves from the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep. It’s just chatter in the mind, and it’s so captivating that we’re not even aware of it. We are essentially in a dream state, and it’s through this veil of thought that we go about our day and perceive our environment. But we are just talking to ourselves nonstop, and until you can break that spell and begin to notice thoughts themselves as objects of consciousness, just arising and passing away, you can’t even pay attention to your breath, or to anything else, with any clarity.”

Sit, Sit. Walk, Walk. Don’t Wobble. “The Zen mantra is ‘Sit, sit. Walk, walk. Don’t wobble.’ . . . It’s this idea that when I’m with a person, that’s total priority. Anything else is multitasking. No, no, no, no. The people-to-people, person-to-person trumps anything else. I have given my dedication to this. If I go to a play or a movie, I am at the movie. I am not anywhere else. It’s 100%I am going to listen. If I go to a conference, I am going to go to the conference.” TF: This is very similar to Derek Sivers’s (page 184) “Don’t be a donkey” rule.

The space and quiet that idleness provides is a necessary condition for standing back from life and seeing it whole, for making unexpected connections and waiting for the wild summer lightning strikes of inspirationit is, paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done. “Idle dreaming is often the essence of what we do,” writes Thomas Pynchon in his essay on Sloth. Archimedes’ “Eureka” in the bath, Newton’s apple, Jekyll and Hyde, the benzine ring: history is full of stories of inspirations that came in idle moments and dreams.

I think people want things that are really passionate, and often, the best version they could be is not for everybody. . . . The best art divides the audience. If you put out a record, and half the people who hear it absolutely love it, and half the people who hear it absolutely hate it, you’ve done well, because it’s pushing that boundary.”

#210% of people will find a way to take anything personally. Expect it and treat it as math. Particularly as you build an audience, this 10% can turn into a big number. Mentally prepare yourself before publishing anything. “Oh, I have 1,000 readers now. That means that 100 are going to respond like assholes. Not because I’m bad, not because they’re bad, but because that’s how the math works.” If you anticipate it, it will throw you off less. On top of that, I assume that 1% of my fans are completely batshit crazy, just like the general population, which helps me handle the far scarier stuff. If you (wrongly) assume that everyone is going to respond with smiles and high-fives, you are going to get slapped, you’ll respond impulsively, and you’ll triple the damage.

Be present above all else. Desire is suffering (Buddha). Anger is a hot coal that you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at someone else (Buddhist saying). If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, don’t work with them for a day. Reading (learning) is the ultimate meta-skill and can be traded for anything else. All the real benefits in life come from compound interest. Earn with your mind, not your time. 99% of all effort is wasted. Total honesty at all times. It’s almost always possible to be honest and positive. Praise specifically, criticize generally (Warren Buffett). Truth is that which has predictive power. Watch every thought. (Always ask, “Why am I having this thought?”) All greatness comes from suffering. Love is given, not received. Enlightenment is the space between your thoughts (Eckhart Tolle). Mathematics is the language of nature. Every moment has to be complete in and of itself.

Memorizing openings is natural, and nearly everyone does it, but Josh likens it to stealing the test answers from a teacher. You’re not learning principles or strategiesyou’re merely learning a few tricks that will help you beat your novice friends. Instead, Josh took me in reverse, just as his first teacher, Bruce Pandolfini, did with him. The board was empty, except for three pieces in an endgame scenario: king and pawn against king. Through the micro, positions of reduced complexity, he was able to focus me on the macro: principles like the power of empty space, opposition, and setting an opponent up for zugzwang (a situation where any move he makes will destroy his position). By limiting me to a few simple pieces, he hoped I would learn something limitless: high-level concepts I could apply anytime against anyone.

#11What if I could only subtract to solve problems? From 2008 to 2009, I began to ask myself, “What if I could only subtract to solve problems?” when advising startups. Instead of answering, “What should we do?” I tried first to hone in on answering, “What should we simplify?”

When we talk about fear or a lack of being aggressive [holding someone back], it’s in your head. Not everybody is going to be super aggressive, but the one thing that you can deal with is a person’s fears. If you start early, if they are a shy person, they won’t be as shy if you keep instilling those things.” TF: Look at whatever you’re afraid of and ask, “What is on the other side of fear, if I push through this?”

All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, For we are made for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth24.

Nothing is more wretched than a man who traverses everything in a round, and pries into the things beneath the earth, as the poet28 says, and seeks by conjecture what is in the minds of his neighbours, without perceiving that it is sufficient to attend to the daemon within him, and to reverence it sincerely. And reverence of the daemon consists in keeping it pure from passion and thoughtlessness, and dissatisfaction with what comes from gods and men. For the things from the gods merit veneration for their excellence; and the things from men should be dear to us by reason of kinship; and sometimes even, in a manner, they move our pity by reason of men’s ignorance of good and bad; this defect being not less than that which deprives us of the power of distinguishing things that are white and black.

But this consists in keeping the daemon within a man free from violence and unharmed, superior to pains and pleasures, doing nothing without purpose, nor yet falsely and with hypocrisy, not feeling the need of another man’s doing or not doing anything; and besides, accepting all that happens, and all that is allotted, as coming from thence, wherever it is, from whence he himself came; and, finally, waiting for death with a cheerful mind, as being nothing else than a dissolution of the elements of which every living being is compounded. But if there is no harm to the elements themselves in each continually changing into another, why should a man have any apprehension about the change and dissolution of all the elements? For it is according to nature, and nothing is evil which is according to nature. This in Carnuntum.

Do not waste the remainder of thy life in thoughts about others, when thou dost not refer thy thoughts to some object of common utility. For thou losest the opportunity of doing something else when thou hast such thoughts as these, What is such a person doing, and why, and what is he saying, and what is he thinking of, and what is he contriving, and whatever else of the kind makes us wander away from the observation of our own ruling power. We ought then to check in the series of our thoughts everything that is without a purpose and useless, but most of all the overcurious feeling and the malignant; and a man should use himself to think of those things only about which if one should suddenly ask, What hast thou now in thy thoughts? With perfect openness thou mightest, immediately answer, This or That; so that from thy words it should be plain that everything in thee is simple and benevolent, and such as befits a social animal, and one that cares not for thoughts about pleasure or sensual enjoyments at all, nor has any rivalry or envy and suspicion, or anything else for which thou wouldst blush if thou shouldst say that thou hadst it in thy mind.

“Hyperthermic conditioning” (calculated heat exposure) can help you to increase growth hormone (GH) levels and substantially improve endurance. I now take ~20-minute sauna sessions post-workout or post-stretching at least four times per week, typically at roughly 160 to 170°F.

“One study has demonstrated that a 30-minute sauna session twice a week for 3 weeks post-workout increased the time it took for study participants to run until exhaustion by 32% compared to baseline. The 32% increase in running endurance found in this particular study was accompanied by a 7.1% increase in plasma volume and 3.5% increase in red blood cell count.”

One is that things do not touch the soul, for they are external and remain immovable; but our perturbations come only from the opinion which is within.

Do what is necessary, and whatever the reason of the animal which is naturally social requires, and as it requires. For this brings not only the tranquility which comes from doing well, but also that which comes from doing few things. For the greatest part of what we say and do being unnecessary, if a man takes this away, he will have more leisure and less uneasiness. Accordingly on every occasion a man should ask himself, Is this one of the unnecessary things? Now a man should take away not only unnecessary acts, but also, unnecessary thoughts, for thus superfluous acts will not follow after.

Think not so much of what thou hast not as of what thou hast: but of the things which thou hast select the best, and then reflect how eagerly they would have been sought, if thou hadst them not. At the same time however take care that thou dost not through being so pleased with them accustom thyself to overvalue them, so as to be disturbed if ever thou shouldst not have them.

The prime principle then in man’s constitution is the social. And the second is not to yield to the persuasions of the body, for it is the peculiar office of the rational and intelligent motion to circumscribe itself, and never to be overpowered either by the motion of the senses or of the appetites, for both are animal; but the intelligent motion claims superiority and does not permit itself to be overpowered by the others. And with good reason, for it is formed by nature to use all of them. The third thing in the rational constitution is freedom from error and from deception. Let then the ruling principle holding fast to these things go straight on, and it has what is its own.

For instance, I spent weeks testing the order of questions for optimal responses. To me, proper sequencing is the secret sauce, whether you’re trying to learn a new language in 8 to 12 weeks,* overcome a lifelong fear of swimming,† or pick the brain of a potential mentor over coffee. Good questions in the wrong order get bad responses. Conversely, you can punch well above your weight class by thinking about sequencing, as most people don’t.

Second, the Buddhist novelist George Saunders said in an interview that he has an image of people’s “nectar in decaying containers.” That image haunts me. When I think of it on a given morning, it allows me to see the Buddha nature flowing through all these lovely, flawed, living, and slowly dying creatures we encounter every day. My three-year-old daughter’s three-year-old self is so temporary. Buddhists observe that we’re all on fire. It’s so beautiful to sometimes tune in and see the flickering.

There are two other mental models that greatly influence my thinking about people and teams. The first is Harvard professor Robert Kegan’s model of adult development. Kegan argues adults developand make sense of realityin five discrete phases. He lays out his theory in the 1994 book In Over Our Heads. The title is a reference to how the vast majority of adult Americans are at the “socialized” stage of development. They have difficulty taking other people’s perspectives and tend to follow assumptions given to them by society (as opposed to assumptions they freely choose). For people interested in learning more about the model, I recommend Kegan’s graduate student Jennifer Garvey Berger’s more recent and less academic book Changing on the Job.

Life will go faster than you know. It will be tempting to live a life that impresses others. But this is the wrong path. The right path is to know that life is short, every day is a gift, and you have certain gifts. Happiness is about understanding that the gift of life should be honored every day by offering your gifts to the world. Don’t let yourself define what matters by the dogma of other people’s thoughts. And even more important, don’t let the thoughts of self-doubt and chattering self-criticism in your own mind slow you down. You will likely be your own worst critic. Be kind to yourself in your own mind. Let your mind show you the same kindness that you aspire to show others.

For instance, if a man should stand by a limpid pure spring, and curse it, the spring never ceases sending up potable water; and if he should cast clay into it or filth, it will speedily disperse them and wash them out, and will not be at all polluted. How then shalt thou possess a perpetual fountain and not a mere well? By forming thyself hourly to freedom conjoined with contentment, simplicity and modesty.

The reason this habit is so important is that even the best policies will fail some percent of the time, and you don’t want to abandon them (or beat yourself up) as soon as one of those inevitable failures pops up.

think most recommendations are bad because they’re one-size-fits-all. “Take more risks.” “Don’t be so hard on yourself.” “Work harder.” The problem is that some people need to take more risks, while others need to take fewer risks. Some people need to ease up on themselves, while others are already too self-forgiving. Some people need to work harder, while others are already skating on the edge of burnout. And so on. So, I think the most useful kind of recommendations are about improving your general judgmentyour ability to accurately perceive your situation (even if the truth isn’t flattering or convenient), your possible options, and the tradeoffs involved. Good judgment is what allows you to evaluate whether a recommendation is appropriate to your situation or not; without it, you can’t tell the difference between good and bad advice.

One distraction I’ve learned to avoid is consuming media that’s just telling me things I already know and agree with (for example, about politics). That stuff can be addictive because it feels so validatingit’s like venting with a friendbut you’re not learning from it, and over time, I think indulging that impulse makes you less able to tolerate other perspectives. So I broke my addiction by, essentially, reminding myself how much time I was wasting not learning anything.

Fortunately, at some point in this process, I remember this principle: Uncertainty over expected value (EV) just gets folded into EV. So, if I know that one of option A or B is going to be great, and the other’s going to be a disaster, but I’m totally unsure which is which, then they have the same expected value. That’s a powerful reframe. Thinking to yourself, “One of these options is great and the other’s terrible, but I don’t know which is which” is paralyzingbut thinking to yourself, “These options have the same expected value as each other” is liberating. (Of course this assumes you can’t cheaply purchase more information about A and B to reduce your uncertainty about which is better. If you can, you should! This advice is about getting yourself to act in situations where there’s no more cheap info left to purchase, and you feel paralyzed.) Let’s say you’re agonizing over two possible jobs you could take, and you feel overwhelmed because you can’t easily tell which one is a better option. Job A is more prestigious and higher-paying, but Job B has a more supportive culture and you’ll have more freedom to choose your projects. What you should ask yourself is, “Is there some way for me to get additional information that would settle this question?” Maybe you could talk to people at the respective companies about their job satisfaction, or you could look at what former employees of A and B go on to do. But maybe you’ve done stuff like that already, and the answers didn’t help settle it for you. If that’s the caseif there’s no additional information you could easily get that would make the “right choice” clearthen you should relax and just pick one without worrying anymore. And I know that “relax and stop worrying” is often easier said than done, but if I can’t tell which one is the better choice, then for all intents and purposes, they’re equally good choices.

However to breathe out one’s life when a man has had enough of these things is the next best voyage, as the saying is. Hast thou determined to abide with vice, and has not experience yet induced thee to fly from this pestilence? For the destruction of the understanding is a pestilence, much more indeed than any such corruption and change of this atmosphere which surrounds us. For this corruption is a pestilence of animals so far as they are animals; but the other is a pestilence of men so far as they are men.

Gratitude. When I was younger, it’s not like I was “ungrateful,” but I never stopped to take the time to reflect on everything I had going for me. Now I do a gratitude practice every morning, every day, and I might even do it again throughout the day. I don’t weigh in too much on the science behind it, I just know if I do it, I feel better. I’m not a believer in “quick fixes” but I know it’s a very effective method to instantly change how you’re feeling. [Here’s what it looks like:] First, I listen to my gratitude playlist on Spotify, any song on the list. For example, here are nine tracks as of today: “Breathturn” by Hammock “Your Hand in Mine” by Explosions in the Sky “Devi Prayer” by Craig Pruess and Ananda “Horizon” by Tycho “Recurring” by Bonobo “Hanging On” by Active Child “Long Time Sun” by Snatam Kaur “Angels Prayer” by Ty Burhoe, James Hoskins, Cat McCarthy, Manorama, and Janaki Kagel “Twentytwofourteen” by The Album Leaf Then, I think of three things that I’m genuinely grateful for. I’ve found the more specific the better. So for example, rather than just thinking, “my mum,” it could be “my mum for making me spinach pie last night.” Instead of “my partner,” it could be “the run I went for with my partner yesterday.” This morning, it was: My son kicking me in my belly My coffee Seeing the sun rise If I do this properly and genuinely (i.e., not just rattling them off in my headthat’s why music helps me to get into the right frame of mind), I’ll usually start crying from gratitude. If I feel frustrated or pissed off during the day, sometimes I’ll do this again to center me.

First, seek out dissenting opinions. Always try to find people who disagree with you, who can honestly and productively play devil’s advocate. Challenge yourself to truly listen to people who have differing ideas and opinions than you do. Stay out of political bubbles and echo chambers as much as possible. Feel good about really hearing those who disagree with you. Try to change your mind about one thing every day. The fact is that when two extreme opinions meet, the truth lies generally somewhere in the middle. Without exposure to the other side, you will naturally drift toward the extremes and away from the truth of the matter. Don’t be afraid of being wrong. Because being wrong is just an opportunity to find more of the truth.

Poker has taught me to disconnect failure from outcomes. Just because I lose doesn’t mean I failed, and just because I won doesn’t mean I succeedednot when you define success and failure around making good decisions that will win in the long run. What matters is the decisions I made along the way, and every decision failure is an opportunity to learn and adjust my strategy going forward. By doing this, losing becomes a less emotional experience and more an opportunity to explore and learn.

In moments when you don’t believe in yourself, you need other people who believe in you. They can hold you up when you falter and keep you from hitting the ground. Other people see you differently from the way you see yourself. And that multiplicity of perspectives is essential to making us who we are.

Five disparate books stand out from all the rest as the most influential, either in confirming my own intuitions or in suggesting promising avenues of inquiry in my quest to understandor at least gain some control overmy unconscious thinking, to be able to tap into it on demand, and to direct it as far as possible. And those books are Zen in the Art of Archery by Eugen Herrigel, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain by Betty Edwards, The Crack in the Cosmic Egg by Joseph Chilton Pearce, The Act of Creation by Arthur Koestler, and, perhaps most of all, The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind by Julian Jaynes. These books have been so seminal to my thinking that I have read each at least three times straight through, and continually dip into them as the years pass as triggers for further insights and inspiration.

The “problem” with meditationI thoughtwas that it wasn’t “practical.” And worse, the time I spent meditating was time that I could have spent analyzing the world. But I eventually reframed meditation as a way to relinquish control of my conscious mind so that my more powerful unconscious mind could take over, and my analysis of the world would improve.

This may come as strange advice from someone who majored in electrical engineering and got a PhD in math modeling of computer security, but I first tell students I encounter to spend the remainder of their time in college filling their minds with the best of the humanities their school has to offer. While classes I took in digital circuits in 1995 have long become outdated, the timeless lessons on fundamental human nature (e.g., John Locke, Thomas Hobbes), the rise and demise of great societies and the inspirational examples set by real-life heroes (e.g., Alexander Hamilton) found in the literature and history classes I took are ones I draw upon even to this day. In a world where we emphasize the creation of new products through rapid iteration and experimentation, we often forget to step back and make sure that the future we are racing to is one we truly want to create. The practice of judgment and reasoning found in philosophy (e.g., Kantian ethics), history, and literature are skills we should continue to hone even when we are out of college, but if we do not start the practice there, it is a process that is difficult to pick up after the fact.

in the first month of starting to work in New York City, my manager at work dispensed free advice that he told me was deeply personal but profoundly important: Develop a philosophy of giving as soon as you enter the working world. He said that I should develop this philosophy when I had few obligations outside of the student debt I had taken on. He suggested that I commit to a percentage of my income and that I consistently donate that amount to charities of my choosing every year. What I didn’t realize then but have come to know in my life is that charitable giving is as much a habit as it is a conscious act. While in any moment, it may feel like there are countless other places where you could use those precious dollars saved up for charitable giving, simply making and keeping such a personal commitment can carry tremendous meaning. I kept that promise to myself from the time I was first working out of college, even into leaner years in graduate school, and my husband and I have reaffirmed that commitment together for our future.

When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do? I go for a walk. Preferably on a route I’ve never taken before. If it’s a routine route, I tend to ignore the surroundings and slip back into thinking about the stuff I’m unfocused on. But if it’s a new route, I focus outward and my mind clears up quickly. Seems like it has to be about 30 minutes or more to really do the job, but nothing refreshes me like walking in a new direction, toward something or somewhere I haven’t headed before.

“Burnout is not the price you have to pay for success.” And I hope billions truly would see it, since so much of the world is still living under the collective delusion that they have to choose between their own well-being and success. Science tells us the complete oppositewhen we prioritize our well-being, our performance goes up across the board. Three-quarters of all startups fail, and entrepreneurship is about making decisions. Nothing impairs the quality of your decisions faster than running on empty.

I have to start with The Meaning of Culture by John Cowper Powys, because it explains something about my relationship to literature (and the other arts). Powys makes the point that the difference between education and culture is that culture is the incorporation of music, art, literature, and philosophy not just into your library or your CV but into who you are. He talks about the interplay of culture and life, the way that what we read can enrich what we experience, and what we experience can enrich what we read.

You have to think of your company as part of a web of life, just like an organism in an ecosystem. If you become too dominant, you suck all the life out of the ecosystem. It gets out of balance, and everyone suffers, eventually even the creatures that think themselves safe at the top of the pile. What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love? Every morning, on my run, I try to take a picture of a flower and share it on Instagram. I was inspired to do this by a passage I read many years ago in a book by C. S. Lewis (I think it was The Great Divorce), in which a character, after death, only sees the flowers as blobs of color, and his spirit guide tells him, “That’s because you never really looked at them when you were alive.” As the line from Hamilton says, “Look around. Look around. How lucky we are to be alive right now!” In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life? When I roll out of bed, I do the

But more important, the idea that we should focus on disruption rather than the new value that we can create is at the heart of the current economic malaise, income inequality, and political upheaval. The secret to building a better future is to use technology to do things that were previously impossible. That was true in the first industrial revolution, and it is true now. It isn’t technology that eliminates jobs, it is the shortsighted business decisions that use technology simply to cut costs and fatten corporate profits. The point of technology isn’t to make money. It’s to solve problems!

“Storms make us stronger.” If I had one message for young people embarking on life, it would be this. Don’t shy away from the hard times. Tackle them head-on, move toward the path less trodden, riddled with obstacles, because most other people run at the first sign of battle. The storms give us a chance to define ourselves, to distinguish ourselves, and we always emerge from them stronger. The other key is to be kind along the way. Kindness matters so much on that journey of endeavor. It is what separates the good from great.

Don’t try to find your passion. Instead master some skill, interest, or knowledge that others find valuable. It almost doesn’t matter what it is at the start. You don’t have to love it, you just have to be the best at it. Once you master it, you’ll be rewarded with new opportunities that will allow you to move away from tasks you dislike and toward those that you enjoy. If you continue to optimize your mastery, you’ll eventually arrive at your passion.

am fine with eating animals when we have to, as long as it is done respectfully. Feeling gratitude for the animal’s life is a good way to honor it. Everything we eat, be it a tomato or a chicken, is carrying light within. This light feeds us a lot more than the calories or protein. By acknowledging this light, by acknowledging the divinity of everything created by Mother Nature, we can feed ourselves twice.

the way to get the strongest is to lift what is optimal and not what is maximal. In general, lifters and coaches tend to lift too heavy, too often. I think it’s human nature in some ways to try to take on more than we can handle. But to make progress, you need to lift and do things that are more realistic. Any time you overreach, you are putting yourself in a compromised position.

People don’t focus on the body as a whole when they squat. Everyone thinks you just use your legs. They think, “You don’t want to hurt your back, so don’t use your back.” But you need an equal amount of push going down through the floor, which is your legs, and push going up, which is your back driving against the bar. This dual action is what allows your hips to activate and move forward like a hinge on a door. If one of those is not working, you fall forward. So I concentrate on hitting the whole, driving with my legs and driving straight up with my back into the bar. That makes the hips react. It’s the same principle in the deadlift.

For the pecs, for instance, you stand at the side of a door frame, place the lacrosse ball directly on the pec tendon, then lean against the wall. If you’re working on your right pec, you’d stand in front of the left side of a door frame, and your right arm would be straight out in front of you, inside the door frame, the right pec (inside your shoulder) pressing the ball into the wall. The key is that you don’t move the ball. Instead, you move your straight arm up and down while pushing against the ball, and you’ll feel that sucker roll over the tendon. You’re causing your own pain, which is more tolerable.

Yet it remains by far the most powerful. As it should be: The Lizard Brain is responsible for an organism’s survival and subsequent evolution, from the very first amoeba to fish to lizards to cavemen to now, of course, you.

Why is it that fear of speaking in front of groups is the biggest Fear we have? Even bigger than fear of death? Yes, fear of rejection plays a part, but there’s more to it than that. The fear of speaking in front of groups is similar to the fear of heights. You feel so close to the edge of your own sanityit’s the fear that you may go insane up there and accidentally tell the truth. And God forbid you do, because the truth is that at every moment of your life, especially this one, you’re scared to death.

If your home life is scary or dysfunctional, in order to not deal with that Fear, you work sixteen hours a day. Or you run ten miles a day so the Fear you’ve repressed can’t catch up to you. To avoid vulnerability, you stay single. To avoid how out of control you feel about Fear, you micromanage and control everyone else. Or you overanalyze every move you make, ensuring that your business stays small and you don’t have to deal with fear of success.

In Zen tradition, the word hell in Japanese can be translated as “no space.” The word heaven can be translated as “spaciousness.” Meaning that if you open up space in your life for Fear or any other Basement Voice to come out and do its thing, you’ll be living in heaven. For none of these voices, including Fear, are a problem if they’re owned and honored. They’re a natural part of you, and you would be incomplete without them. Owned and honored, they offer wisdom and an honest perspective that includes a full vision of who and what you are. Imagine how much easier life would be if you could just allow yourself space to say, I feel afraid. I feel inadequate. I am being abusive. Sometimes I, too, am rude. Do you see how much tension you must hold to remain shut down to any part of your “dark” side? But it’s not so easy, is it? Due to repression, the wisdom of Fear and these other “bad” voices have become more lost over time. Now all you’re aware of is their dark and hellish

Because among my clients, chronic pot smokerswhen they decide to quitoften report feeling very angry. Anger finally has a chance to come out of the basement. Which suggests that they smoke to self-medicate, so that they don’t have to deal with Anger (and the underlying Fear).

Here are a few drills you can use to land. These drills allow you to embody, and therefore become, any voice, not just the Body. ​Stand up and stretch open space in between your thoughts, bones, ligaments, etc. A voice needs space to enter, or else it won’t. ​Many spiritual traditions seek to make the Body so uncomfortable (fasting, excessive heat or cold, slapping) that you can’t help but become it. So imagine being thirsty. Not just any kind of thirst, eitheryou’re in a 110-degree desert for days without water. Can you see you are now your Body? Now, imagine that it grows and grows until you become the Thirst. Every cell in your body is the Thirst, until the mind or Self no longer exists. This illustrates the full embodiment of a voice. ​In Zen, there’s a riddle: How do you fall into a thousand-foot-deep well? The answer is: You just take a step over the edge, and down you go. You just do it. Same here. ​It’s hard to think and breathe at the same time. Get out of your head by breathing as the Body for a spell, then talk as the voice of the Body. ​If you’re thinking about a past injury or where a pain comes from, that is not the voice of the Body. The body has no recall of past or future. Its truth exists only in this moment. ​Put your hand on your head; speak from there. Now put your hand on your heart. Or your solar plexus, your belly, etc. Speak from there instead. You are now the voice of one part of the Body. ​If I ask you, as the Body, “How do you feel?” start your sentences with the words “I feel . . .” You may say: “I feel cold.” “I feel sad.” “I feel afraid.” Or whatever it is you are aware off. And that’s it. That’s your truth. ​Stay curious. The second there’s a judgment (like “I should put on a sweater”) or a need to know (like “Why am I feeling sad?”), you’re back in the Thinking Mind. If this happens, simply add another drop of curiosity and ask the question again“What do I feel?”and in an instant, answer the question anew as the voice of the Body. ​You must be fully present. Visiting Paris means nothing until you allow yourself to feel the wind on your face and smell the flowers in springtime. Until then, you’re not really in Paris. You must integrate and fully experience these sensations to really be there.

The Body is where your emotions are authentically available, both the ones showing up anew and the recirculating ones you’ve neglected in the past. They are all available to you, as they exist in this moment. Joy may be experienced in the heart, arms, or rib cage and feel very expansive. Fear may be experienced in the chest, throat, forehead, and shoulders, among other places, and feel constricted. The Body will speak to you and give you access to these emotions without confusion, anytime you’re available to listen.

How do you make a sword? It’s not easy. You stick the steel in intense heat and then pound on it with a hammer. Then stick it in intense cold and pound on it some more. Over and over you do this.

1. I wake up and feel however I’m feeling. Let’s say today I feel Anxiety, Stress, and discomfort. Call it by any other name, but this is Fear. 2. I ask my Self a few questions then, before starting my day: Why do I feel Fear? (Looming deadline, embarrassed about my latest Facebook rant.) Where do I feel it? (In my throat.) Am I resisting it? (Usually yes, dammit.) 3. If I am resisting it, I first spend one or two minutes fully embracing and embodying that Resistance. I might say out loud, “I don’t want this” or “Ugh, not now,” so the Resistance has a chance to speak. That’s often enough for it to run its course so I can go on to step 4. 4. I might make hot chocolate and sip it with a cat on my lap, and just feel the discomfort. Or I may talk about it with my husband or, if he’s not around, a friend over the phone. There’s little to no story, just “I’m feeling afraid right now” or “I’m afraid.” They know not to say, “There’s nothing to be afraid of” or I will smack them. Or maybe I just start my workday, feeling the discomfort, yet remain curious about it. (“It just switched to my chest; isn’t that interesting?”) I may get to work on that deadline, or Facebook-post a cute kitten video to dilute my previous behavior, and the Fear dissipates because I’m doing something proactive toward alleviating the situation that warrants Fear. 5. Chances are, at some point the Stress and Anxiety (Fear) will dissipate, and all I did was feel my feelings and live my truth that showed up that morning. If it doesn’t run its course quickly, I continue to remain curious until I notice that (hey, look at that) Fear is done talking, then remain curious about any new feeling that has shown up.

Fear is not the problem; Resistance to Fear is the problem. So please, if it shows up, don’t resist the Resistance; become Resistance, for as long as it takes. Only as much as you’re willing to do this can it run its course, and make room for its opposite to enter. Which is what we’re going for next; Embracing or, as I prefer to call it, Honoring.

How you do this is you shift into the voice of Honored Fear, and notice whatever you notice. Perhaps breathe into the different parts of your body that feel the discomfort. How does Fear feel in the solar plexus, in the heart? Keep doing this, one location at a time, and notice how long it takes before that body part stops feeling uncomfortable.

When Anger is owned, there’s also no blame. No one is ever the reason for your Anger. When you talk about it, you don’t ever say, “You are making me angry.” Instead, your sentences start with “I”: “I feel angry,” said with integrity, without drama. That’s saying, “I own this energy. It’s mine. It comes from me. I am not a victim to it, but instead made powerful because of it.” This is how it turns you into a master.

People have a tendency to attribute an experience to a place and then fall in love with it, continuously wanting to go back thinking that every time you go back it will be equally enjoyable. Just because I had an amazing experience somewhere once doesn’t mean it will always be great. The likelihood is that it will become less exciting over time.

Locke argued that our goals are willful objectives that guide our behavior based on our values. In that way, they are achieved for our benefit. The two most important factors of effective goal setting are: 1. specificity: The more specific a goal is, the more likely you are to achieve it. A goal of running ten miles is much clearer and more achievable than a goal of running far, as there is no clear definition of far. 2. difficulty: There is a direct correlation between how difficult the goal is and how much effort people will put in to achieve it.11

You will undoubtedly find yourself in situations in which people get upset at you or you make a gamble that doesn’t pan out. This can be understandably uncomfortable; nobody enjoys disappointing people, getting yelled at, or discovering they are in a difficult situation. Our default reaction is likely to take it personally, but there is another option. The first thing you need to do is distance yourself from the situation by viewing it as a researcher collecting data. Sometimes that data is exciting, and other times it involves someone yelling and screaming. A researcher is not attached to the result; he or she is just interested in the data.

Apologizing for something that is not a clear issue in many cases only draws more attention to it, making it an issue.

You either got the person’s phone number or you didn’t, you scored more points, ate more hot dogs, ran more miles, or hit a ball farther.  TIME LIMIT: The challenge must be completed by a specific time.  THRESHOLD OF SKILL: A challenge needs to feel like it is at the limit of your ability. If it is too grandiose, it will seem impossible, and too easy will be boring.

Nerves are natural. It’s normal to be anxious, so don’t concern yourself with what other athletes might be thinking or how well they seem to be doing. We often don’t suspect that others are overcome with or overwhelmed by anxiety. No matter how calm your opponents may appear, they are likely experiencing the same level of anxietyor more sothan you are.

Get creative and use your imagination. For instance, give the anxious feeling an imaginary form (such as a sparkler or firecracker) and then place it in an imaginary safe place or container that will protect you from it. Understand that you are bigger and more powerful than this anxious feeling.

Take yourself lightly. A competition is an opportunity to test your fitness, challenge the competition, and demonstrate how hard you’ve worked. You are not your game. Take what you are doing seriously, but learn to take yourself lightly. Always remember that sport is what you do and not who you are. Smile. Laugh. Have a good time.

For millennia, blue light existed only during the daytime. Candles and wood fires produced reddish-yellow light, and there was no artificial lighting at night. Firelight isn’t a problem, because the brain interprets red light as a signal for bedtime. Blue light is a different story, because it signals morning. So 95 percent of us are inducing jet lag at night by telling our bodies that the day is beginning just before we go to bed.

People are never really sure of their own self-worth, which can’t be measured like weight, or height, or income. Some people obsess over social feedback more than others do, but we’re social beings who can’t ever completely ignore what other people think of us. And more than anything, inconsistent feedback drives us nuts. Instagram is a font of inconsistent feedback.

When people are deprived of these bonds, they experience a form of pain so severe that it’s sometimes called “the social death penalty.”

There is good early evidence to support the idea that small doses of mental hardship are good for us. Young adults do much better on tricky mental puzzles when they’ve solved difficult (rather than easy) ones earlier. Adolescent athletes also thrive on challenges: we’ve found, for example, that college basketball teams do better when their preseason schedules are more demanding. These mild initial struggles are critical. Depriving our kids of them by handing them a device that makes everything easier is dangerouswe just don’t know how dangerous.

“Kids shouldn’t be exposed to screens before the age of two,” she says. Their interactions, Cash argues, should be direct, social, firsthand, and concrete. Those first two years set the standard for how those kids will interact with the world when they’re three and four and seven and twelve years old, and so on. “They should be allowed to watch passive TV till they reach elementary schoolaround age sevenwhen they should be introduced to interactive media, like iPads and smartphones,” Cash says. She also suggests limiting screen time to two hours per day, even for teenagers. “It’s not easy,” she admits. “But it’s critical. Kids need sleep and physical activity, and family time, and time to use their imaginations.” Those things can’t happen when they’re lost in screenworlds.

They were projecting the very emotions they had been asked to suppress onto the world around them. Those who were instead encouraged to express their fears were far less likely to believe the man in the video was afraid. By expressing their own fears, they were freed from the preoccupation with fear that plagued the suppressors.

It’s disempowering. You’re the child in an invisible relationship, forced not to do something you’d like to do, and, like children, many people are drawn to whatever they’re not allowed to do. In contrast, “I don’t” is an empowering declaration that this isn’t something you do. It gives the power to you and signals that you’re a particular kind of personthe kind of person who, on principle, doesn’t use Facebook.

According to a phenomenon known as the planning fallacy, even if we’re short on time today, we assume we’ll have more time in the future. That’s why people say “no” to many requests that fall within the next week, but “yes” to similar requests that fall several months in the future. This is a mistake, because your level of spare time today is an excellent guide to how much time you’ll have in a couple of months.

Gamification researchers Kevin Werbach and Dan Hunter examined over one hundred examples of gamification, and identified three common elements: points, badges, and leaderboards. PBL, as the triad is known, first came together in airline frequent-flyer programs. United launched the first airline loyalty program in 1972, long before the advent of gamification, and other airlines soon introduced similar programs. With each flight or qualifying purchase, flyers earn points in the form of miles; when they earn enough points in a single year, they win badges in the form of status markerssilver, gold, platinum, and so on; and high-status members stand in different lines, board the plane first, and sometimes receive special treatment on the airplanerewards that function as a conspicuous leaderboard.

Create a powerful image such as a battleship, a fierce animal, or a volcanic eruption. Or simply picture a successful lift before actually attempting one.  Make powerful movements such as pumping your fist or clapping your hands.  Repeat energizing thoughts such as “Yes, I can!” or “Get my A-game on!”  Recall your favorite up-tempo song. Throttle down. Perhaps you need to decrease your intensity level between periods of a hockey game or innings of a baseball or softball game. Here are a few ways you can throttle down.

Here are some of the differences between playing to not lose and playing to win:  Playing so as not to lose is rooted in fear. Playing to win is based in confidence.  Playing so as not to lose puts you constantly back on your heels. Playing to win keeps you on your toes.  Playing so as not to lose stymies all of your abilities as you over- or undertry. Playing to win allows you to play within yourself.  Playing so as not to lose causes muscle tension (and mistakes). Playing to win frees you to perform at your best (tension-free).  Playing so as not to lose is about merely surviving. Playing to win is about thriving.  Playing so as not to lose makes for stressful moments. Playing to win creates special moments.

In her wonderful book The Molecules of Emotion, Dr. Pert says that “the life of a cell, what it is up to at any moment, is determined by which receptors are on its surface, and whether those receptors are occupied by ligands or not.”1 A ligand is a small molecule that binds itself to a cellular receptor.

In the film What the Bleep Do We Know!?, Dr. Joseph Dispenza explains that when a new cell is produced, it isn’t always a clone of the old cell but a cell that contains more receptors for whatever peptide it received that caused it to split. If the cell received peptides produced by emotions of depression, the new cell will have more receptors for depression and fewer receptors to receive feel-good peptides.

An estimated 300 million cell divisions occur every minute to replace cells that die. Each day, two percent of your blood cells die and are replaced by fresh ones. Every two months, you have an entirely new blood supply. Given what we now know about peptides, receptors, and the role of emotions and thoughts, you can see the chain of events that takes place as new cells are created according to what you think and feel.

For the Universe to continue to exist, it can only permit the best possible events, perfect events, to occur at any moment in time. If it were otherwise, the Universe would be in danger of its own destruction because one imperfect event could lead to two imperfect events, to three, and so on unto destruction. Imperfect events are not tolerated, not even once. Since our Universe has continued for all those billions of years, there can be little doubt about the perfection of its construction.

It is this screen of thought that creates the illusion of separateness, the illusion that there is you and a totally separate “other.” You then forget the essential fact that, underneath the level of physical appearances and separate forms, you are one with all that is. By “forget,” I mean that you can no longer feel this oneness as self-evident reality. You may believe it to be true, but you no longer know it to be true. A belief may be comforting. Only through your own experience, however, does it become liberating.

Instead of “watching the thinker,” you can also create a gap in the mind stream simply by directing the focus of your attention into the Now. Just become intensely conscious of the present moment. This is a deeply satisfying thing to do. In this way, you draw consciousness away from mind activity and create a gap of no-mind in which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking.

If you set yourself a goal and work toward it, you are using clock time. You are aware of where you want to go, but you honor and give your fullest attention to the step that you are taking at this moment. If you then become excessively focused on the goal, perhaps because you are seeking happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self in it, the Now is no longer honored. It becomes reduced to a mere stepping stone to the future, with no intrinsic value. Clock time then turns into psychological time. Your life’s journey is no longer an adventure, just an obsessive need to arrive, to attain, to “make it.”

In the normal, mind-identified or unenlightened state of consciousness, the power and infinite creative potential that lie concealed in the Now are completely obscured by psychological time. Your life then loses its vibrancy, its freshness, its sense of wonder. The old patterns of thought, emotion, behavior, reaction, and desire are acted out in endless repeat performances, a script in your mind that gives you an identity of sorts but distorts or covers up the reality of the Now. The mind then creates an obsession with the future as an escape from the unsatisfactory present.

To alert you that you have allowed yourself to be taken over by psychological time, you can use a simple criterion. Ask yourself: Is there joy, ease, and lightness in what I am doing? If there isn’t, then time is covering up the present moment, and life is perceived as a burden or a struggle. If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, it does not necessarily mean that you need to change what you are doing. It may be sufficient to change the how. “How” is always more important than “what.” See if you can give much more attention to the doing than to the result that you want to achieve through it. Give your fullest attention to whatever the moment presents.

The best indicator of your level of consciousness is how you deal with life’s challenges when they come. Through those challenges, an already unconscious person tends to become more deeply unconscious, and a conscious person more intensely conscious. You can use a challenge to awaken you, or you can allow it to pull you into even deeper sleep.

So it is essential to bring more consciousness into your life in ordinary situations when everything is going relatively smoothly. In this way, you grow in presence power. It generates an energy field in you and around you of a high vibrational frequency. No unconsciousness, no negativity, no discord or violence can enter that field and survive, just as darkness cannot survive in the presence of light.

Only a surrendered person has spiritual power. Through surrender, you will be free internally of the situation. You may then find that the situation changes without any effort on your part.

When you are on a journey, it is certainly helpful to know where you are going or at least the general direction in which you are moving, but don’t forget: The only thing that is ultimately real about your journey is the step that you are taking at this moment. That’s all there ever is. Your life’s journey has an outer purpose and an inner purpose. The outer purpose is to arrive at your goal or destination, to accomplish what you set out to do, to achieve this or that, which, of course, implies future. But if your destination, or the steps you are going to take in the future, take up so much of your attention that they become more important to you than the step you are taking now, then you completely miss the journey’s inner purpose, which has nothing to do with where you are going or what you are doing, but everything to do with how. It has nothing to do with future but everything to do with the quality of your consciousness at this moment. The outer purpose belongs to the horizontal dimension of space and time; the inner purpose concerns a deepening of your Being in the vertical dimension of the timeless Now. Your outer journey may contain a million steps; your inner journey only has one: the step you are taking right now. As you become more deeply aware of this one step, you realize that it already contains within itself all the other steps as well as the destination.

When you focus within and feel the inner body, you immediately become still and present as you are withdrawing consciousness from the mind.

There is a simple but powerful self-healing meditation that you can do whenever you feel the need to boost your immune system. It is particularly effective if used when you feel the first symptoms of an illness, but it also works with illnesses that are already entrenched if you use it at frequent intervals and with an intense focus. It will also counteract any disruption of your energy field by some form of negativity. However, it is not a substitute for the moment-to-moment practice of being in the body; otherwise, its effect will only be temporary. Here it is. When you are unoccupied for a few minutes, and especially last thing at night before falling asleep and first thing in the morning before getting up, “flood” your body with consciousness. Close your eyes. Lie flat on your back. Choose different parts of your body to focus your attention on briefly at first: hands, feet, arms, legs, abdomen, chest, head, and so on. Feel the life energy inside those parts as intensely as you can. Stay with each part for fifteen seconds or so. Then let your attention run through the body like a wave a few times, from feet to head and back again. This need only take a minute or so. After that, feel the inner body in its totality, as a single field of energy. Hold that feeling for a few minutes. Be intensely present during that time, present in every cell of your body. Don’t be concerned if the mind occasionally succeeds in drawing your attention out of the body and you lose yourself in some thought. As soon as you notice that this has happened, just return your attention to the inner body.

On the physical level, you are obviously not whole, nor will you ever be: You are either a man or a woman, which is to say, one-half of the whole. On this level, the longing for wholeness  the return to oneness  manifests as male-female attraction, man’s need for a woman, woman’s need for a man. It is an almost irresistible urge for union with the opposite energy polarity. The root of this physical urge is a spiritual one: the longing for an end to duality, a return to the state of wholeness.

Judgment is either to confuse someone’s unconscious behavior with who they are or to project your own unconsciousness onto another person and mistake that for who they are. To relinquish judgment does not mean that you do not recognize dysfunction and unconsciousness when you see it. It means “being the knowing” rather than “being the reaction” and the judge. You will then either be totally free of reaction or you may react and still be the knowing, the space in which the reaction is watched and allowed to be. Instead of fighting the darkness, you bring in the light. Instead of reacting to delusion, you see the delusion yet at the same time look through it. Being the knowing creates a clear space of loving presence that allows all things and all people to be as they are. No greater catalyst for transformation exists. If you practice this, your partner cannot stay with you and remain unconscious.

A victim identity is the belief that the past is more powerful than the present, which is the opposite of the truth. It is the belief that other people and what they did to you are responsible for who you are now, for your emotional pain or your inability to be your true self. The truth is that the only power there is is contained within this moment: It is the power of your presence. Once you know that, you also realize that you are responsible for your inner space now  nobody else is  and that the past cannot prevail against the power of the Now.

These are the mechanics of unconsciousness. You can still make your point clearly and firmly, but there will be no reactive force behind it, no defense or attack. So it won’t turn into drama. When you are fully conscious, you cease to be in conflict. “No one who is at one with himself can even conceive of conflict,” states A Course in Miracles. This refers not only to conflict with other people but more fundamentally to conflict within you, which ceases when there is no longer any clash between the demands and expectations of your mind and what is.

To offer no resistance to life is to be in a state of grace, ease, and lightness. This state is then no longer dependent upon things being in a certain way, good or bad. It seems almost paradoxical, yet when your inner dependency on form is gone, the general conditions of your life, the outer forms, tend to improve greatly. Things, people, or conditions that you thought you needed for your happiness now come to you with no struggle or effort on your part, and you are free to enjoy and appreciate them  while they last. All those things, of course, will still pass away, cycles will come and go, but with dependency gone there is no fear of loss anymore. Life flows with ease.

True relationship becomes possible only when there is an awareness of Being. Coming from Being, you will perceive another person’s body and mind as just a screen, as it were, behind which you can feel their true reality, as you feel yours. So, when confronted with someone else’s suffering or unconscious behavior, you stay present and in touch with Being and are thus able to look beyond the form and feel the other person’s radiant and pure Being through your own.

Surrender is the simple but profound wisdom of yielding to rather than opposing the flow of life. The only place where you can experience the flow of life is the Now, so to surrender is to accept the present moment unconditionally and without reservation. It is to relinquish inner resistance to what is. Inner resistance is to say “no” to what is, through mental judgment and emotional negativity. It becomes particularly pronounced when things “go wrong,” which means that there is a gap between the demands or rigid expectations of your mind and what is. That is the pain gap.

The second key, don’t translate, was hidden within my experiences at the Middlebury Language Schools in Vermont. Not only can a beginning student skip translating, but it was an essential step in learning how to think in a foreign language. It made language learning possible. This was the fatal flaw in my earlier attempts to learn Hebrew and Russian: I was practicing translation instead of speaking. By throwing away English, I could spend my time building fluency instead of decoding sentences word by word.

I began making flash cards for the pronunciation rules, added a bunch of pictures for the nouns and some verbs, learned the verb conjugations, and then built up to simple French definitions of more abstract concepts.

A good grammar book will walk you through your language’s grammar in a thoughtful, step-by-step manner.1 On the way, it will introduce you to a thousand words or so, give you a bunch of examples and exercises, and provide you with an answer key. You will skip 90 percent of the exercises in the book, but having them around will save you a lot of time once we begin to learn grammar. If the book gives you “Englishy” pronunciation for each word (Bonjour: bawn-JURE, Tschüss: chewss), I give you permission to burn it and find a different one.

Your first task in language learning is to reach the next level: sound. Sound connects structure to your ears and your mouth and allows you to speak. You’ll start by learning the sounds of your language and which letters make those sounds, because if you begin with sound, you’ll have a much easier time remembering words. Our college students remembered twice as many APPLEs (which do, in fact, rhyme with Snapple) as they did BEARs (which has four capital letters). Sound is the land of rote memorization. We take a name, like Edward, or a pair of words, like catgato, and we repeat them, continuously activating the parts of our brain that connect structure to sound.

This rewriting process is the engine behind long-term memorization. Every act of recall imbues old memories with a trace of your present-day self. This trace gives those memories additional connections: new images, emotions, sounds, and word associations that make your old memory easier to recall.

Feedback is a simple concept with dramatic results. If we encounter our gato flash card and get stumped, then we can simply look at the back side of the card and see a picture of a cat. We have just given ourselves immediate feedback, and as a result, one of two things happens. If our memory of gato has vanished, then we start over. We form a new, “original” experience at the moment we got stumped and looked at the answer. This is not as good as remembering our actual original experience, but it’s still very effective.

If you take just a moment to figure out how to remind yourself of the meaning of a word, you can retain that word forever.

Subjects like languages and the sciences can’t be understood simply by memorizing factsthey require explanation and context to learn effectively.

It’s a terribly difficult consonant to nail down for an American. I’ve spent a good half hour repeating after a recording of the word rāmen to prepare for one of my pronunciation demo videos, and I still can’t hear the damn thing or produce it well.

Half of a good accent is simply a matter of timing. Singers learn pronunciation first, and as a result, we don’t have to fight years of bad habits. We learn to parrot words accurately before we have any idea what they mean, so that we can get onto a stage without embarrassing ourselves. You should do the same.

I’ve made a series of YouTube videos to help you get the pronunciation information you need (Fluent-Forever.com/chapter3). Watch them. They take thirty-five minutes, and at the end, you’ll understand how your mouth does what it does. In those videos, I go over a tremendously valuable tool known as the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). It was created, naturally, by the French, who needed some way to deal with the fact that four of the five letters in haies (hedges) were silent (it’s pronounced “eh”). The phonetic alphabet they developed does two awesome things: it turns languages into easily readable sounds, and it tells you exactly how to make each of those sounds. In English, there are ten ways to spell the “oo” sound in the word too. In IPA, there is only one, always: u.

Every IPA letter is not only a sound but also a set of instructions on how to make that sound. This is super useful.

In general, you only need three pieces of information to make any sound: you need to know what to do with your tongue, with your lips, and with your vocal cords, and there aren’t that many options.

run face first into a German word like Höchstgeschwindigkeitsbegrenzung (speed limit). Now what? Each of the sounds isn’t particularly hard, but how do you get your tongue to jump through so many hoops in a row? Go backward. Say the end of the word, and then add one letter at a time until you can say the whole thing. Let’s try the Russian word for “flinch” (as in “I flinch whenever I see this word”), vzdrognu. It manages to string together four consonants in a row before reaching its first vowel. Ick. We’ll go backward. While you might have trouble saying “vzdrognu,” you can say “nu.” Now you can add a letter and practice saying “gnu.” Once that’s comfortable, keep building up, one letter at a time:

This is called back-chaining, and it’s an old singer trick that can work tongue-related miracles. You’re using muscle memory to trick your tongue into doing things it wasn’t able to do before. While your tongue can’t handle eight new movements at once, it can handle a single new combination of two familiar sounds.

Not all words are created equal; we use certain words far more often than others. English has at least a quarter of a million words. But if you only knew the top hundred words in English, you’d recognize half of everything you read. We get a lot of mileage out of our most frequent words. To be fair, many of these words are so-called function wordsold standbys like be and of, in, and onand they behave differently in every language, so you can’t start with them. You’ll need a few nouns before you can put something “in” them or “on” them. Still, even if you set function words aside for a moment, you’ll find a small group of useful, simple words that you use all the time.

PERSONAL CONNECTIONS: I can’t give you your personal connections, but I can give you questions to help spur your memories. Use them whenever you have trouble finding a good memory for a new word. When you do, ask yourself about your new word rather than its English translation. Instead of asking about the last time you saw your mother, ask about the last time you saw your mère.

That book isn’t just useful for its translated sentences. Grammar rules, too, are worth learning; studies show that you’ll learn a language faster when you learn the rules. You don’t need to drill themas we’ve discussed, grammar drills won’t help you skip over any developmental stagesbut a passing familiarity with grammar can help you logically break down complex sentences into chunks you can understand, and the more sentences you understand, the faster you’ll learn.

even a beginning student can still take his rudimentary knowledge of grammar rules and use it to understand our flower story, even if he can’t produce it easily on his own. And by understanding that sentence, he feeds his language machine and progresses one step closer to fluency. This is a subtle point. If every sentence you understand brings you closer to fluency, then what’s the problem with grammar drills? Don’t they count as comprehensible input? Indeed they do. They’re just not particularly interesting. If you’re the sort of person who loves filling out conjugation tables (I sit, you sit, he sits, she sits, it sits, we sit, they sit…) then by all means, go ahead. These are understandable sentences, and they’ll feed your language machine just fine.

You can move on to the next section. In short order, you’ll get an overview of the entire grammatical system of your new language, which will enable you to understand and absorb almost anything. You’ll also pick up a ton of vocabulary at the same time; you can’t learn the plural for fritelle (ridiculously awesome doughnut balls from Venice) without also learning the word for “ridiculously awesome doughnut balls from Venice” (get the ones full of crema).

You’ll need some way to remember all of the data in that declension table, but you only have one lousy story about a student. Now what? You can create your own stories. Use that declension table to quickly generate a bunch of variations on whatever examples you find in your textbook. You can write She is a doctor and stick that story on a flash card within a few seconds. In contrast with the meaningless (or perhaps philosophical) She is, your “She is a doctor” story is easy to visualize, and it means something quite different than the original example from your textbook, “I am a student.” You’ll have an easy time remembering it, and it’s the sort of clear comprehensible input that makes language machines thrive.

There are hundreds of these, and they drive English students crazy. But hidden within the chaos, there are always patternslittle islands of regularity, like steal/stole/stolen, choose/chose/chosen, and speak/spoke/spoken. When you’re learning a grammatical form for the very first timesuppose you were learning English, and steal/stole/stolen was your first irregular verblearn it with example sentences, as we did earlier: Jon stole a delicious hamburger yesterday. George has stolen pizzas in fifty states. But you don’t need to make example sentences for your next irregular verb, choose/chose/chosen. You’ve already learned that pattern; you just need to somehow connect choose to the pattern you learned with steal. This is where declension charts come in handy. While they’re not very good for learning new patterns, they make it very easy to see patterns we’ve already learned. We’re good at seeing patterns; it’s why we speak our native languages so well. If you’ve already learned to use a verb like steal, you’re going to have a much easier time learning all three forms of a similar verbchoose/chose/chosenall at once. You can stick those three forms (or even a giant French declension chart) on the back of a flash card.

One of the core mnemonic weapons in any competitor’s arsenal is known as the person-action-object (PAO) system, and we’re going to use a simplified version of it to attach mnemonic images to our words.

Adjectives can fit into PAO as well, but they’re rarely complex enough to warrant some elaborate story like Bruce Lee eats a large/cold/happy hot dog. Instead, you can just use a simple mnemonic object. For example, French has five adjectivesbeautiful, new, crazy, soft, and oldthat follow a single, irregular pattern. We can connect them with a single object: a beautiful football, a new football, a crazy footballand easily remember the pattern in the future.

It felt the same way your body feels after a day of splitting wood, or swimming, or sex. You feel exhausted, languorous, and almost Godlike. This feeling was similar, except it was my intellect that was weary and expanded, languid and latently powerful.

How many times do we pay for one mistake? The answer is thousands of times. The human is the only animal on earth that pays a thousand times for the same mistake. The rest of the animals pay once for every mistake they make. But not us. We have a powerful memory. We make a mistake, we judge ourselves, we find ourselves guilty, and we punish ourselves. If justice exists, then that was enough; we don’t need to do it again. But every time we remember, we judge ourselves again, we are guilty again, and we punish ourselves again, and again, and again. If we have a wife or husband he or she also reminds us of the mistake, so we can judge ourselves again, punish ourselves again, and find ourselves guilty again. Is this fair?

If we compare the dream of human society with the description of hell that religions all around the world have promulgated, we find they are exactly the same. Religions say that hell is a place of punishment, a place of fear, pain, and suffering, a place where the fire burns you. Fire is generated by emotions that come from fear. Whenever we feel the emotions of anger, jealousy, envy, or hate, we experience a fire burning within us. We are living in a dream of hell.

Why your word? Your word is the power that you have to create. Your word is the gift that comes directly from God. The Gospel of John in the Bible, speaking of the creation of the universe, says, “In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word is God.” Through the word you express your creative power. It is through the word that you manifest everything. Regardless of what language you speak, your intent manifests through the word. What you dream, what you feel, and what you really are, will all be manifested through the word.

Take the example of Hitler: He sent out all those seeds of fear, and they grew very strong and beautifully achieved massive destruction. Seeing the awesome power of the word, we must understand what power comes out of our mouths. One fear or doubt planted in our mind can create an endless drama of events. One word is like a spell, and humans use the word like black magicians, thoughtlessly putting spells on each other.

Everything you feel or believe or say that goes against yourself is a sin. You go against yourself when you judge or blame yourself for anything. Being without sin is exactly the opposite. Being impeccable is not going against yourself. When you are impeccable, you take responsibility for your actions, but you do not judge or blame yourself.

impeccable means “without sin.” Religions talk about sin and sinners, but let’s understand what it really means to sin. A sin is anything that you do which goes against yourself. Everything you feel or believe or say that goes against yourself is a sin. You go against yourself when you judge or blame yourself for anything. Being without sin is exactly the opposite. Being impeccable is not going against yourself. When you are impeccable, you take responsibility for your actions, but you do not judge or blame yourself.

When you feel good, everything around you is good. When everything around you is great, everything makes you happy. You are loving everything that is around you, because you are loving yourself.

Even the opinions you have about yourself are not necessarily true; therefore, you don’t need to take whatever you hear in your own mind personally. The mind has the ability to talk to itself, but it also has the ability to hear information that is available from other realms. Sometimes you hear a voice in your mind, and you may wonder where it came from. This voice may have come from another reality in which there are living beings very similar to the human mind. The Toltecs called these beings Allies. In Europe, Africa, and India they called them the Gods.

Intent from the Toltec point of view is that part of life that makes transformation of energy possible; it is the one living being that seamlessly encompasses all energy, or what we call “God.” Intent is life itself; it is unconditional love.

Each wound is infected with emotional poison  the poison of all the emotions that makes us suffer, such as hate, anger, envy, and sadness. An action of injustice opens a wound in the mind and we react with emotional poison because of the concepts and beliefs we have about injustice and what is fair.

Victims repress because they are afraid to show the emotions, afraid to say what they want to say. To refrain is not the same thing as repression. To refrain is to hold the emotions and to express them in the right moment, not before, not later. That is why warriors are impeccable.

In parts of East Asia, which suffers perhaps the greatest epidemic of indoor-itis, rates of nearsightedness in teenagers surpass 90 percent. Scientists used to attribute myopia to book-reading, but it instead appears to be closely linked to time spent living like naked mole rats, away from daylight. The sun primes the retina’s dopamine receptors, and those in turn control the shape of the developing eye.

Our visual cortex picks up snake patterns and movements more quickly than other kinds of patterns. It’s likely that snakes even drove the evolution of our highly sensitive depth perception, according to University of California anthropologist Lynne Isbell. She discovered special neurons in the brain’s pulvinar region, a visual system unique to humans, apes and monkeys. Primates who evolved in places seething with venomous snakes have better vision than primates who didn’t evolve in those places.

Even so, the law firm was far more liberal than most. It was a Jewish firm, and in my experience, I have found Jews to be more broad-minded than most whites on issues of race and politics, perhaps because they themselves have historically been victims of prejudice. The fact that Lazar Sidelsky, one of the firm’s partners, would take on a young African as an articled clerksomething almost unheard of in those dayswas evidence of that liberalism.

There is little favorable to be said about poverty, but it was often an incubator of true friendship. Many people will appear to befriend you when you are wealthy, but precious few will do the same when you are poor. If wealth is a magnet, poverty is a kind of repellent. Yet, poverty often brings out the true generosity in others.

William Smith was a Coloured man involved in the African real estate trade who was often around the office. Smith was a veteran of the ICU (the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union), South Africa’s first black trade union, founded by Clements Kadalie, but his views had shifted dramatically since those days. “Nelson,” he said, “I have been involved in politics for a long time, and I regret every minute of it. I wasted the best years of my life in futile efforts serving vain and selfish men who placed their interests above those of the people they pretended to serve. Politics, in my experience, is nothing but a racket to steal money from the poor.”

Less than half of all African children of school age attended any school at all, and only a tiny number of Africans were graduated from high school. Even this amount of education proved distasteful to the Nationalists. The Afrikaner has always been unenthusiastic about education for Africans. To him it was simply a waste, for the African was inherently ignorant and lazy and no amount of education could remedy that. The Afrikaner was traditionally hostile to Africans learning English, for English was a foreign tongue to the Afrikaner and the language of emancipation to us.

She was poor and apparently homeless, but she was young and not unattractive. I knew of course that there were poor whites, whites who were every bit as poor as Africans, but one rarely saw them. I was used to seeing black beggars on the street, and it startled me to see a white one. While I normally did not give to African beggars, I felt the urge to give this woman money. In that moment I realized the tricks that apartheid plays on one, for the everyday travails that afflict Africans are accepted as a matter of course, while my heart immediately went out to this bedraggled white woman. In South Africa, to be poor and black was normal, to be poor and white was a tragedy.

Before the arrests I had deliberately cut down my weight, in anticipation of prison, where one should be lean and able to survive on little. In jail, I had continued my exercises, and was pleased to be so trim. But Jabavu eyed me suspiciously. “Madiba,” he said, “why must you look so thin?” In African cultures, portliness is often associated with wealth and well-being.

The women were courageous, persistent, enthusiastic, indefatigable, and their protest against passes set a standard for antigovernment protest that was never equaled. As Chief Luthuli said, “When the women begin to take an active part in the struggle, no power on earth can stop us from achieving freedom in our lifetime.”

I have always believed that to be a freedom fighter one must suppress many of the personal feelings that make one feel like a separate individual rather than part of a mass movement. One is fighting for the liberation of millions of people, not the glory of one individual.

But my career as a lawyer and activist removed the scales from my eyes. I saw that there was a wide difference between what I had been taught in the lecture room and what I learned in the courtroom. I went from having an idealistic view of the law as a sword of justice to a perception of the law as a tool used by the ruling class to shape society in a way favorable to itself.

The structure and organization of early African societies in this country fascinated me very much and greatly influenced the evolution of my political outlook. The land, then the main means of production, belonged to the whole tribe and there was no individual ownership whatsoever. There were no classes, no rich or poor and no exploitation of man by man. All men were free and equal and this was the foundation of government.

The act of turning away when I asked about Molly was typical of Bram’s character. He was a stoic, a man who never burdened his friends with his own pain and troubles. As an Afrikaner whose conscience forced him to reject his own heritage and be ostracized by his own people, he showed a level of courage and sacrifice that was in a class by itself. I fought only against injustice, not my own people.

I much preferred being outside in nature, being able to see grass and trees, to observe birds flitting overhead, to feel the wind blowing in from the sea. It felt good to use all of one’s muscles, with the sun at one’s back, and there was simple gratification in building up mounds of stone and lime.

Slaying the forests triggered a chain reaction. The soil, once shielded from the torrential tropical rain by the dense vegetation, was carried away. Each year 1.6 billion tons of fertile soil was lost to erosion, much of it settling in lakes and creeks, reducing the country’s supply of fresh water. Some of this soil ended up in neighbouring countries.

After careful deliberations, the policy-makers made two critical decisions: first of all to do nothing, in order to avoid embarrassment to the Emperor, who was portrayed to the world outside not just as the oldest ruler in sunny Africa, but also as a caring and considerate father figure; and secondly, to actively suppress any news of the drought or any talk of famine.

The land occupied by the Somalis is, for the most part, an arid savannahan endless steppe punctuated by acacia trees, huge anthills and the thick-trunked baobabs. Somalis are nomadic pastoralists, their favoured domestic animal being the one-humped camel. This beast is the hardiest of all animals. In the dry season, it can go without water for more than three weeks. Between rains, Somalis can be seen driving a caravan of camels for a week or more, without regard for political borders, as they search for water holes and grazing lands. They repeat this arduous task, without rest, until the rains come. The nomads themselves subsist, during this period, entirely on camels’ milk.

The three European powers who had a stake in the area were France, Italy and Britain. The British interest was exceedingly simple. They had a colony across the gulf, in Aden, which had a very strong naval base. This colony needed a reliable supply of meat for its army and subjects. As the main suppliers of meat in the area were the Somali nomads, what better way to ensure the continuity of its supply than to annex its source? The British weren’t greedy. They didn’t wish to occupy the entire Somali holding, just a strip of land on the north coast of the region. They didn’t send armies to quash the nomads, but negotiated their way in, setting up shop on the Horn in 1884. The successful, low-cost entry of the English in the region gave the French ideas. Why not grab the port of Djibouti? The port was exactly what they were looking fora short route to Europe, aided by the majestic Suez Canal, which had opened its gates in 1869. Like the British, the French negotiated a protectorate agreement with the dominant clan of the region, the Issa. In 1888, France set up camp in Djibouti, one of the harshest regions on the Horn. France would rule this port for the next ninety years. The Italians were the last to arrive, but their prize was by no means smaller than the others’. Indeed, Italy had staked out for itself the longest coastal territory on the Horn, bordering the English possessions and running along the Indian Ocean. This acquisition, along with Eritreawhich had come under Italian rule a few years earlierwas considered the perfect launching point for a campaign to take the grand prize of them all: Ethiopia.

The Americans refused to send arms. Only months after promising $22 million worth of fighting equipment, they were struck with second thoughts. It seemed immoral to support what was obviously a Communist venture. Americans hate communism, and fight it by supporting other Communists. The United States turned its back on Ethiopia, and offered its hand to Somalia. At the height of the conflict, on July 26, 1977, the Americans signed a friendship treaty with Somalia, promising to sustain the arms supply. The U.S. also encouraged the Muslim countries of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Sudan to funnel aid to their cousins in the south.

Finally, help came in. The Soviets sent $100 million worth of arms, promising more would follow. The Soviets were still supplying arms to the Somalis: there were thousands of Soviet military advisers on that small desert strip. The Soviets didn’t see any contradiction in arming both sides. After all, both Somalia and Ethiopia were socialist rookies, so the aid was obviously advancing the cause of socialism.

I was touched by this display of generosity, by the spectacle of this angelic character who made a difference in the lives of poor shepherd boys. When I couldn’t restrain my curiosity any longer, I walked to the driver’s seat and asked him why he was so kind. A shadow fell over his face. In a serious tone of voice he admitted to me that he had no choice. Perched high on the cliffside, stones at their feet, the kids could really damage buses.

Many theories were advanced to explain the spectacular success of Kulubi, but the most popular one, by far, had to do with its location. Because the church was on higher ground, and was therefore closer to the heavens, prayers offered from its confines could of course be more easily heard.

The mayhem was public. The regime did not deny it. After all, the proof was out on the streets for everyone, including the foreign diplomats, to see. But the world outside kept its silence, as no one’s economic interests had been compromised, and the most vocal opponents of the regime had been either done to death or made to rot away in various dungeons. And so the campaign was allowed to run its full course, coming to a halt only when it ran out of fuel.

When disciplining us, Dad would tell us to choose the branch that we deserved. It was his interpretation of democracy. The whole business was very tricky. We had to weigh the pros and cons of each branch, so that it was not too hard, for obvious reasons, yet not too flimsy either, so that he didn’t use the belt instead, which would have been by far the most painful. After carefully trimming the leaves from the branch, we would hand it to Dad, grip first.

Other peasants managed to express their displeasure in a less risky but equally powerful way: through output. A 1983 report by the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed what we had always known, that private farms invariably outperform collective ones. Comparative yields for private and collective farms tell the whole story: for barley, private farms produced an average of 11.5 quintals per hectare while collective farms yielded just 6.48; for wheat, the comparative yield was 13.2 to 2.38; for maize, 20.2 to 11.05; for sorghum, 12.5 to 3.47; and for teff, the main staple food of most Ethiopians, the figure was a staggering 11.3 to 0.52.

When an enthusiastic member flashed his Koran before media cameras, a group of the Brotherhood's own protestors pushed him down and held up the Egyptian flag. The Brotherhood realized it was crucial to avoid the perception that the organization, or political Islam more generally, was playing a major role in stirring or directing the events; the country did not want the revolt to be dominated by one particular ideology, and any such perception would have allowed the Mubarak administration to paint the entire uprising as inspired by the Brotherhood.

The country that was a beacon for tranquillity, the society that was an example of peacefulness and tolerance  one that had never witnessed a civil war in over seven thousand years  has turned into the Middle East's most productive breeding ground of aggression. In three decades, Egypt witnessed an internal struggle between its government and armed groups working not only to overthrow the regime, but to overhaul the entire society; and an escalating tension between its two main religious groups. The country was also the birthplace of modern militant jihadism and the incubator of many of the groups that evolved to become international terrorist structures.

In Egypt, over the past six decades, the society did not progress; on many fronts, it actually regressed. Politically, despite the introduction of a multi-party system in the 1970s and the undertaking, since then, of a number of parliamentary elections, democracy, the rule of law and the respect of the rights of the citizen were diluted. The country's political system descended to frightening levels of coercion, oppression and cruelty. Economically, despite significant improvements in the country's infrastructure (especially in utilities and telecommunications), and despite an average GDP growth rate of circa 6 per cent throughout the 2000s, Egypt was ranked in the lower 40 per cent of all developing countries in the UN's 2007 Human Poverty Index. This was a reflection of the difficulty of Egyptians' daily lives, from the crumbling education system and decrepit heath care, to humiliating transportation. There were more factories, bridges and highways, higher mobile telecoms penetration and increasing access to the Internet, but the economic development of the country, relative to the countries that used to be considered its international peers, had deteriorated significantly. In 2007, 32 per cent of the population were completely illiterate (42 per cent of women), 40 per cent of the population were at or below the international poverty line and GDP per capita (at purchasing power parity) was less than half that of Turkey and 45 per cent of South Africa's. And, crucially, there was not only a sense of confusion, resentment and rejection among the Egyptians  especially the younger ones, but increasingly an overarching feeling of an irreparable damage, a national defeat. The story of what happened to Egypt and the Egyptians, how and why, is interesting  albeit sad.

Ismael was determined to make Egypt ‘a part of Europe’. It was during his reign that Egypt's railway, including Cairo's splendid Al-Mahatta (central station), was built, initially linking Cairo with Alexandria, and later with the key cities of the Nile Delta. Ismael adorned Cairo with Paris-, Rome- and Vienna-inspired buildings, palaces, parks and quarters. In effect, he commissioned the building of modern Cairo.

He modernized Cairo and Alexandria by developing municipal services  from the supply of gas and water, to official policing, to a modern sewage system and street lighting. In the international arena, Ismael was keen to have Egypt represented in international conferences on issues ranging from health and hygiene to post and telegraphy.9 The epitome of Ismael's attempts to market his Egypt internationally, and especially in Europe, was the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. This was marked with almost a full month of celebrations, an all-expenses-paid festival to which many European notables were invited (led by Empress Eugenie of France)  ‘the century's grandest party’.10

Soon after, Britain sent warships to Alexandria to reinforce the khedive's position. The chain of events culminated in the Tel El-Kebir battle in September 1882 in which the British forces annihilated Urabi's garrisons. It marked the beginning of Britain's occupation of Egypt.

Free trade, open markets and vast opportunities for wealth creation turned Egypt into a regional commercial and trading destination. One consequence was a flow of immigrants; the number of foreigners in the country rose from 10,000 in the 1840s (the first relatively reliable census) to around 90,000 in the 1880s, and more than 1.5 million by the 1930s.

Hussein's most important work, and his major contribution to the cultural stimulation of the era, was a serious examination of how Egypt's liberal spirit (in the 1930s and 1940s) could be reconciled with Islam. His book The Future of Culture in Egypt29 argued for what came to be called ‘the Ideology of Pharaonism’, which asserted the uniqueness of Egypt's culture and identity, as opposed to eastern-ism or Islamism. He envisaged Egypt developing along cultural and social lines inspired by European societies' progress and experience after the French revolution and throughout the Industrial Age. He summarized his view by repeatedly emphasizing that Egypt's future was ‘north, across the Mediterranean’, not in the midst of the Arab world.

The Egyptian military was traditionally loyal to the monarchy. But Egypt's humiliating defeat at the hands of Israel in the 1948 war had alienated large groups of young officers who felt that their monarch (and government) had failed them by sending them into war badly prepared and with inadequate weapons.

In July 1952, while Al-Wafd's leaders were relaxing in St Moritz and Cannes, a number of armed brigades mounted a coup against King Farouk. The people poured joyfully into the streets, and cheered on the young officers who led the coup as agents of change. This swift action, conducted by less than a hundred officers  almost all drawn from junior ranks  ended the country's political experiment of the previous half century. In less than twelve months, the young officers abolished monarchism, established republicanism, put an end to the country's parliamentary system, abolished political parties and jailed (or sidelined) almost all the key politicians of the ‘bygone era’. The July 1952 coup quickly turned into a revolution that  with the people's blessing  initiated a new phase in Egypt's history.

But behind it lies a vital historical fact: that Gamal Abdel Nasser signifies the only truly Egyptian developmental project in the country's history since the fall of the pharaonic state. There had been other projects: a Greek one in Alexandria, an ArabIslamic one under the Ummayads (the first dynasty to rule the Islamic world after the end of the era of the ‘Rightly Guided Caliphs’), militaryIslamic ones under Saladin and the grand Mamelukes, a French one under Napoleon's commanders and a dynastic (Ottoman-inspired) one under Mohamed Ali Pasha and Khedive Ismael. But this was different  in origin, meaning and impact. For Nasser was a man of the Egyptian soil who had overthrown the Middle East's most established and sophisticated monarchy in a swift and bloodless move  to the acclaim of the millions of poor, oppressed Egyptians  and ushered in a programme of ‘social justice’, ‘progress and development’ and ‘dignity’: a nation-centred developmental vision.

Nasser's development programme was frenetically action-oriented as well as rich in rhetoric. In the space of a few years following the July 1952 coup that abolished Egyptian monarchism, Nasser overhauled Egypt's entire political system; sidelined the political class that had ruled Egypt for half a century, replacing the Turco-dominated aristocracy with ordinary Egyptians, who at least in theory represented the will and aspirations of the masses; emasculated all political parties; tried (and in many cases imprisoned) most of the key politicians of the ‘bygone era’; created a new constitutional order; and established a new system based on an ultra-powerful presidency supported by an executive government, the legitimacy of which was derived from the consent (albeit without formal electoral channels) of the people.

The second pillar of Nasser's economic revolution was the public sector. This new class of state-owned factories, companies and enterprises was, as with the land-reform drive, in effect created in the late 1950s and early 1960s from the proceeds of the nationalization of almost all of Egypt's sizable businesses. The underlying philosophy was also similar: to remodel the structure of wealth by transferring ownership from a narrow capitalist class at the very top of the country's socio-economic pyramid to millions of ordinary employees, poor labourers and struggling workers.

He was now both an Egyptian hero and an Arab one, capable of ‘defeating the nation's enemies’ and ‘representing Arab dignity’.

Nasser's project benefited from the intellectual infrastructure that the easternists had laid out in the 1930s and 1940s and from Al-Baath's propaganda in the Levant.

Nasser's personal experience also played a role in his insistence on Arabizing, rather than Islamizing, his project. Nasser spent his formative years in Alexandria when the city was buzzing with cosmopolitanism and liberalism, and when Egypt as a whole was at the apex of the liberal experiment. Nasser's defining experience was his participation in the 1948 war against Israel. He fought alongside Palestinian farmers  Muslims as well as Christians, who saw themselves as Arabs. The strategic struggles he studied as a young officer (the Arab revolt against the Turks and the BritishFrench carving of the Middle East into respect ive spheres of influence) defined ‘his people’ as ‘Arabs’ not ‘Muslims’.

Egyptian liberalism's facade was alluring. But, to most Egyptians, it lacked a substance that they could relate to. It failed to reform the country's corrupt and debilitated monarchy; it failed to put forward a development programme for the country's poor who constituted the vast majority of the population; it failed to ‘Egyptianize’ the cultural themes and currents it had imported from London and Paris; and it failed to secure its cultural advances in institutional terms (so that they translated into a better educational system, job opportunities, improved living standards or more dignity for ordinary Egyptians in their own country).

Most observers claim that Egypt's dramatic change of political course, from being leader of the confrontational Arab nationalist project to a pliable ally of the United States, has diluted Egypt's standing in the Arab world. This is certainly true, but it is not the main reason. In the 1950s and 1960s, Nasser's call on Egyptians to rise beyond their local problems to meet the challenges of ‘their nation’ resonated with Egypt's historical ex perience. Egyptians, at the time, saw their country as the natural leader of the Arab world. The land of history, culture and sophistication had an almost missionary role in its region. And that message did not sound condescending to its non-Egyptian recipients. The Arabs of the Gulf, the Levant, North Africa and Sudan were appreciative of the qualities and qualifications of their ‘older sister’. At that time, a grand Arabic project emanating from Cairo had credibility.

That dichotomy has changed how the average Arab views the average Egyptian  from a teacher and potential leader to a follower and lower-level worker; and how the average Egyptian ranks him- or herself in the Arab world. Cairo and Alexandria have lost some of their ‘soft power’ to Beirut, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. That change of perception also affected the traditionally revered ‘Egyptian fighter’ who led the ‘Arab nation's’ 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973 wars, as well as volunteered in the wars to liberate Algeria and Yemen. In the 1980s and 1990s, however, thousands of Egyptians were forced conscripts and paid fighters constituting the bulk of Iraq's 200,000 reservoir in its war with Iran. The ‘Egyptian fighter’ was also absent from the Arabs' most important struggle against Israel in the last thirty years: the IsraeliHezbollah wars in southern Lebanon.

MORE THAN A million mourners packed Cairo's streets in June 1998 in a display of grief for Sheikh Mohamed Metwalli Al-Sharaawi, Egypt's (and the Arab world's) most popular and successful Islamic preacher.

The Sheikh's views shaped Egyptian society's agenda as well. Al-Sharaawi's fatwa that ‘humans do not own their bodies’  and hence his prohibition of organ-transplant operations  was a key factor behind the Egyptian parliament's repeated blocking of legislation on the issue.

The place of religion in Egyptians' social lives had been changing in the Nasserite years of the 1950s and 1960s. Arab nationalism and its associated progressive ideologies pushed religion (Christianity as well as Islam) back into the private sphere of homes, mosques and churches, and away from the public arena of streets, schools and universities. The uncompromisingly civic nature of the Nasserite state relegated religion to the matter of a relationship between the person and his/her God.

The change can be measured in the increase in the proportion of women in Egypt wearing the veil, from less than 30 per cent to more than 65 per cent in two decades; by the early 1990s, the veil was established as the dress code on the Egyptian street rather than as an occasional choice. In the less-privileged villages of the Nile Delta, as well as in Cairo's and Alexandria's poorest neighbourhoods, the veil became the natural step for girls as young as twelve.

The law also prosecuted those ‘who propagate views that are not in step with divine religions’.

This story might appear irrelevant to the history of Islamism in Egypt over the past few decades. However, it was a milestone that led to the marginalization of the different schools of Islamic philosophy (falsafah); and it was that marginalization that paved the way for the emergence of the literalist movement of Koranic interpretations for the first time in the Muslim world. The dominance of this school in Baghdad, Damascus and later Cairo (especially after the fall of the Ayyubids and throughout the Mameluke period) stifled many creative movements and initiatives that could have enriched Islamic

Qutb also drew on his own first-hand experience in the United States (as a graduate student specializing in education in Colorado, 194850) to denounce Western society as a whole as a land of infidels; to argue that Egyptian society, like all Muslim societies at the time, was living in a jahiliyah (the days of ignorance before Islam was revealed to Prophet Mohamed); to depict nationalist leaders such as Nasser as apostates ‘eradicating Islam from its lands’; to reject the notion of countries and states, arguing that they are ‘idols’ invented by man to replace God; and to contend that society needed a revolution to be accomplished by a ‘new Koranic generation’. In that specific point, Qutb was influenced by Abu Al-Ala Al-Mawdudi, Pakistan's leading twentieth-century theological theorist, who introduced the concept of God's sovereignty (Al-Hakimeyah Al-Ilaheya), and argued that Western democracy, by empowering humans to ‘rule’, was antithetical to Islam's governing foundations which accept no ruling but that of God.

Qutb was executed by hanging in 1966, having been accused with five other Brotherhood members of plotting to overthrow the regime and assassinate Nasser. His ideas had a life of their own, however. He emerged as the godfather of militant Islamism; and almost a decade after his death, his ideas became the theoretical platform for a number of militant groups terrorizing Egyptian society in the name of Islam.

The story of Ayman Al-Zawahiri (head of Al-Qaeda following Osama bin Laden's killing in May 2011), his transform ation from a successful surgeon to a leader of a violent group, bent on the murder of thousands, is a perfect example of the radicalization of segments of the Egyptian middle class. Al-Zawahiri, the son of an upper middle-class family who had grown up in Al-Maadi, an affluent Cairene suburb, joined the Muslim Brotherhood at the age of fifteen right after the 1967 defeat. He quickly moved from the Brotherhood's ordinary ranks to join (and create) independent, highly radicalized cells. Though he had no links to the murder of Sadat, he was imprisoned in the major incarceration waves that followed the crime, and was sentenced to three years. Having served his prison sentence, he emigrated to Saudi Arabia, then soon afterwards to Afghanistan to join in the fight against the Soviets. It was during that time that he met Dr Abdullah Azzam, the Palestinian godfather of many militant Islamic groups and the founder of the Jihad Service Bureau, the vehicle that helped recruit thousands of Arabs to the Afghanistan War. Al-Zawahiri became a close friend and confidant of Azzam. After the Soviets' withdrawal from Afghanistan, he returned to Egypt where he became the effective leader of the Al-Jihad group. In 1992, Dr Al-Zawahiri joined his old Arab Afghan colleague, the Saudi multi-millionaire Osama bin Laden, in Sudan, and from there he continued to lead Al-Jihad, until its merger with Al-Qaeda in 1998. Dr Al-Zawahiri presented his thinking and rationale for ‘jihad by all means’ in his book Knights under the Prophet's Banner.38

But the violence was not only directed at the ‘infidel Westerners’ (though they, and the tourism industry, were especially prized victims). Egyptians also suffered: between 1982 and 2000, more than 2,000 Egyptians died in terror attacks  from the speaker of parliament to a number of secular writers and commentators (for example, Farag Foda, a prominent and controversial writer, was assassinated in 1992, and in 1994 an assassination attempt was made against Egypt's Nobel Literature Laureate Naguib Mahfouz), to a series of senior police officers,39 and children caught up in the blasts.

The episode was a sad example of the deterioration of liberalism and tolerance in Egypt. In 1922, a committee was tasked with putting together the first draft of the 1923 constitution. The committee, which comprised five Christians, one Jew and six Muslims, instituted Article 1 (that Islam is the religion of the state) unanimously. And interestingly the five Christian committee members were the ones who rejected a clause, suggested by a Muslim, to have a minimum number of parliamentary seats and ministerial posts reserved for Christians. ‘It would be a shame for Egyptian Christians to be appointed, not elected,’ commented one of the Christian committee members. That was the era when a Christian politician such as Makram Ebeid Pasha, the legendary general secretary of Al-Wafd, was elected for six consecutive terms to the parliament in a constituency with virtually no Christians. Sadly, those were different times.

There was a major demographic boom in Egypt from the 1980s, in which the population almost doubled from around 45 million to 80 million, but there was also a notable increase in literacy and urbanization. The literacy rate in Egypt increased from around 45 per cent in the early 1970s to 65 per cent in the early 2000s, with the greatest improvement among those under thirty-five years of age (who were also the generation best equipped to engage with modern technology, from satellite channels to the Internet, to wireless communication). The demographic distribution of the country crammed the majority of those young Egyptians into Cairo, Alexandria and a few other urban centres where living conditions were increasingly difficult. The thwarted aspirations of these relatively educated youths, in a public environment dominated by corruption, patronage and authoritarian rule, was propitious for Islamism: the ‘pure divine ideology’ and the opposite of everything that might have contributed to current problems  from Nasser's Arab nationalism to Anwar Sadat's and Hosni Mubarak's westernization and pragmatism. Islamism was perceived as a positivist form of rejection. Unlike the utter negativity and nihilism of terror,49 ‘a return to true Islam’ seemed to offer a medicine for the social sickness  even if the nature of that Islamism was hardly defined and the medicine was utterly vague.

The rise of the ‘new Gulf’ has also contributed to the appeal of Islamism across different segments of Egyptian society  including the upper middle classes and the rich. The Gulf region has undergone impressive development at the same time as Egypt has stagnated  in terms of economic growth, living standards, internationalization and of becoming an attractive destination for world-class expatriates. This has given credence in the Arab world to the notion that development and progress need not be associated with Western lifestyles, schools of thought and social frameworks.

The same apparent indecisiveness is conspicuous in the Brotherhood's interaction with key international players, most notably the United States. After the group's parliamentary victory of 2005, the Brotherhood sought to position itself as an interlocutor and a potential partner of the West, and especially the United States. But that outreach runs against the Brotherhood's attempt to placate its support base, the millions of pious  and at times very angry  young Egyptians who strenuously oppose Washington's foreign policies and almost invariably associate the United States both with Israel and the region's dictatorial regimes. It was, for example, notable that despite some encouraging comments from a number of the Brotherhood's leaders regarding President Obama's visit to Cairo in June 2009, the Brotherhood's public line was hardly welcoming. ‘The visit would be useless unless it is preceded by real change in the policies of the US Administration…the US is trying to recruit all Arab States in favour of Israel,’ the group's website said. The Brotherhood also, after a number of conciliatory engagements and interactions with the West, retreated into its comfort zone of inflammatory rhetoric intended for local consumption: all suicide-bombers are ‘martyrs’; ‘Israel’ regularly became ‘the Jews’; even its theological discourse became more confrontational and oriented to social conservatism.

The group's intellectual dilemma goes deeper. The Brotherhood is torn: between the conservative (and often rejectionist) ideas on which it was founded;53 the progressive arguments of some of its foster children (such as Tariq Ramadan) who see room for cooperation with the West; and the views of those  less intellectual but perhaps more influential inside Egypt  who engage in vibrant discussions on many Islamist Internet blogs, exploring ideas in often daringly creative ways. The resulting confusion and fragmentation exact their price on the group's standing. The Brotherhood is increasingly excluded from discussions in areas where it could have made a contribution and found a hearing, such as strategies to counter terrorism and ways to achieve conciliation in the increasingly tense SunniShii relationships in the Levant and the Gulf.

Ahmed Bahaa El-Din, ex-editor-in-chief of Al-Ahram, recounts in My Conversations with Sadat the broad and sweeping effects that Sadat envisaged would materialize as a result of al-infitah.

But the excesses of the 1970s; the pressures on the middle class; the emergence of a new upper class of merchants, middlemen, brokers and shady liaisons; and the unabashed alliance between power and money  all were turning Sadat's vision into an empty promise. Millions of Egyptians felt cheated, that their reward was instead being reaped by a privileged elite floating over them.

For example, in 1982 (Mubarak's first year in office) oil revenues were equal to circa 75 per cent of Egypt's total merchandise export (the main output of the economy). This bred an inherent unpredictability and reliance on external forces.

The World Food Programme estimated that the cost of living for an average Egyptian household had risen by more than 75 per cent between the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s. The higher prices of bread and basic food staples led to violent clashes in long lines for government-subsidised loaves; in 2008 at least ten people died in one such incident.

Liberal capitalism has made significant strides in Egypt, but its close association with the Mubarak regime and the blurring of the lines between power and wealth in the last decade placed it on the receiving end of the people's anger after the 2011 revolution. Following the uprising, and under immense pressure from various groups that were at the centre of the revolution, the public prosecutor launched an active and wide-reaching anti-corruption campaign.

Egyptian Christians, in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth, were at the forefront of the renaissance that propelled the country towards a cultural and economic resurgence. The Christian Takla family, in 1875, founded Al-Ahram, Egypt's pre-eminent daily newspaper. George Abyad was the creative force behind the birth of the Egyptian theatre. Ya'acoub Artin guided the transformation from a religion-based teaching doctrine towards a civic educational system. Christians who were close to the experiment of the Levant's House of Wisdom (Dar Al-Hikma) were among the leading figures that founded Fuad I University (later Cairo University), the first Western-styled educational institution in the Arab world.

The outstanding role of Egyptian Christians in formulating Egyptianism stemmed from their solid status as an integral component of Egypt's social fabric  not a marginal minority in a Muslim society. Egypt was, in Christian doctrine, the Holy Family's early host; the Virgin Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus fled to the country to avoid the turmoil in Palestine in the early years of the first century.

Christianity's peacefulness corresponded with the Nile valley's serenity and quiet farming life; and by the fourth century, Christianity was the religion of almost all Egyptians from Alexandria in the north to the deep Saeedi south. There are a number of studies on the early years of Christianity in Egypt, and the reasons the new religion proved highly successful in the country. On one side, Christian theology resembled many aspects of old Egyptian religions: the holy trinity of a father, mother and son-god; the virgin birth; and the resurrection from death. But perhaps more importantly, Egyptians saw in the new humane religion a reprieve from the oppression of the pagan Romans, and a solid socio-political catalyst for differentiating themselves from their occupiers.

For more than four centuries following Islam's conquest of Egypt (in 640 CE), the vast majority of Egyptians remained Christian. Islam's conquest of Egypt has always been a historical puzzle: a weak army of around 4,000 warriors taking over a huge country such as Egypt and defeating its strong Roman garrison. One reasonable explanation is that the Egyptian population, antagonistic towards the Roman rulers, threw their lot in with the Arab invaders, seeing them as political liberators, rather than the heralds of a new divine revelation. It was only the establishment of Arabic as the state's official language at the beginning of the eighth century that compelled Egyptian Christians to start learning Arabic in order to keep their jobs in government and administrative offices, and that presaged a wave of conversions to Islam.7 Christians, however, remained more than 40 per cent of the country's population until the mid-sixteenth century.

On the other side of the polyunsaturated coin, we have the omega-6 fatty acids. These are also essential to a healthy brain, but the American diet now includes far too many of them in the form of linoleic acid. These omega-6 fats went from appearing in our diet as oils delivered in trace quantities by whole foods to becoming major caloric contributors to the American diet in just a few short decades. They are the predominant type of fatty acid found in the grain and seed oils that we now consume in excess: safflower, sunflower, canola, corn, and soybean oils.

Two of the most important omega-3 fats are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These are the “good” fats found in fish such as wild salmon, mackerel, and sardines, in krill, and in certain algae. They’re also found in smaller amounts in grass-fed beef and pasture-raised eggs. While EPA is a whole-body anti-inflammatory agent, DHA is the most important and abundant structural component of healthy brain cells.

As coveted as polyunsaturated fats are by the brain, they are delicate and highly vulnerable to a process called oxidation. Oxidation occurs when oxygen (you may have heard of it) reacts chemically with certain molecules to create a new, damaged “zombie” molecule that has a super-reactive extra electron, called a free radical.

Radicals are typically four orders of magnitude (10,000x) more reactive than non-radical molecules. Their action is not under genetic control, they attack nearly all biological molecules, destroying lipids, proteins, nucleic acids [DNA], hormones and enzymes until the radicals are quenched by scavenger molecules.

Chronic inflammation or diseases like type 2 diabetes impair our ability to fight the accumulation of oxidative stress, and this is compounded when we absorb excess pro-oxidants from our food. It only takes a small amount of oxidative stress to set off a nuclear chain reaction of biochemical destruction, and the balance is a delicate one.

Intact (let’s call them fresh) polyunsaturated fats are vulnerable to oxidation, but when they appear in their natural state, contained in whole foods, they are bundled with fat-guarding antioxidants like vitamin E. This is not the case when polyunsaturated fats appear in oils that have undergone heat and chemical processing. When these oils are extracted and used to create packaged foods, they represent one of the major toxins in our food supply.

A properly functioning neuron must have the ability to increase or decrease its sensitivity to outside signals, and it does this by increasing and decreasing the number of buoys allowed to the surface. For this to occur, the cell membrane must possess the property of fluidity. This is true of most cells in the body, but it is especially important for neurons. If the nerve cell membrane is too rigid, receptor availability is impaired and can result in dysfunctional signaling, thus influencing our moods, behaviors, and memories.

While exercise is one of the best overall ways to boost this powerfully protective growth hormone, consuming omega-3 fats, and particularly DHA, is among the best dietary means that we know of. DHA is so important for building a healthy brain that researchers believe it was access to this special fat that allowed our early hominid brains to reach their current size. This may explain why the consumption of fish, leading to higher blood levels of omega-3 fats including DHA, is correlated with greater total brain volume over time.19 But don’t write off DHA’s usual sidekick, EPA: inflammation is a well-known BDNF brain drain, and EPA is a powerful inflammation quencher.

This is the protective coating that insulates neurons and allows for speedy neurotransmission. However, unlike polyunsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats are chemically stable. Oils composed primarily of these fats not only are safe to consume but seem to have a number of positive effects in the body. Some common sources of monounsaturated fat include avocados, avocado oil, and macadamia nuts, and the fat content of wild salmon and beef is nearly 50 percent monounsaturated. But perhaps the most famous source of monounsaturated fat is extra-virgin olive oil.

The bulk of trans fats consumed by humans are the result of industrial manufacturing. These man-made trans fats are not just bad; they’re Darth VadermeetsLord Voldemort bad. They begin life as polyunsaturated oils (which can freely pass the blood-brain barrier), and are pumped with hydrogen. You can see these on food packages if you look for hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils. This process makes them behave more like saturated fats, becoming solid at room temperature. Food manufacturers like this for two reasons: it allows them to add a rich, buttery texture to foods using cheap oils, and it extends the shelf life of those foods.

A final but incredibly important benefit of adding more good fats to your diet (in the form of fat-rich foods like eggs, avocado, fatty fish, and extra-virgin olive oil) is that fats facilitate the absorption of critical fat-soluble nutrients like vitamins A, E, D, and K, as well as important carotenoids like beta-carotene.

To make it, tubes are inserted into the throats of healthy geese and ducks and they are force-fed grain (usually corn). With the animals eventually consuming far more carbohydrates than they ever would in a natural setting, the livers swell with fat, growing to nearly ten times their normal size. The swelling can be so severe that it impairs blood flow and increases abdominal pressure, hindering the animal’s ability to breathe. Sometimes the liver and other organs will even rupture from the stress. Cruel and inhumane, it provides an excellent, if extreme, illustration of exactly what we’re doing to ourselves as a consequence of chronic sugar consumption: developing fat-filled livers and creating foie gras right inside of our own bodies.

Sugar-protein bonding (glycation) can occur to any protein in the presence of sugar. All carbohydrates, with the exception of fiber, have the potential to glycate. While end-products of glycation, AGEs, may be consumed in food, the vast majority are formed in your body as a result of chronic carbohydrate consumption. Isolated fructose creates stress on the liver, which promotes inflammation and insulin resistance. Sugar interacts with genes in the brain, reducing neuroplasticity and impairing cognitive function.

When insulin is elevated (due to frequent high-carbohydrate meals or excessive caloric intake), our ability to break down amyloid becomes handicapped. This is partially due to a protein called insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). As the name suggests, IDE breaks down the hormone insulin, but it also has a side job (who doesn’t these days?): it’s part of the enzymatic cleanup crew that also degrades amyloid beta. If the brain had a never-ending supply of IDE, it would perform both tasks effectively, but unfortunately, IDE supply is limited, and it has a stronger preference for degrading insulin than it does for amyloid. In fact, the presence of even small amounts of insulin completely inhibits IDE’s breakdown of amyloid.

Some other great rules to integrate into your definition of self might be that you’ll “only eat red meat if it comes from a kindly treated animal that has been fed what it really wants to eat (that’s grass) its entire life,” or that you’ll “never consume any beverages that have been sweetened with sugar,”

Cholesterol is a vital nutrient for the body, and particularly for the brain, where 25 percent of the body’s total cholesterol content can be found. It’s a critical component of every cell membrane, where it provides structural support, ensures fluidity of nutrient transport into and out of the cell, and may even serve as a protective antioxidant. It’s essential for the growth of myelin, the insulating sheath that surrounds your neurons. (Myelin becomes a casualty in multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune condition.) It’s also important for maintaining brain plasticity and conducting nerve impulses, especially at the level of the synapse; depletion of cholesterol at this level leads to synaptic and dendritic spine degeneration.5 Dendritic spines, the branch-like touch-points that facilitate neuron-to-neuron communication, are thought to be the physical embodiment of memories.

It’s believed that LDL particles serve an antimicrobial purpose, containing docking sites called LPS-binding proteins that allow them to soak up renegade LPS.17 When the liver senses that LPS has entered circulation via inflammation signaling, it ramps up production of LDL to bind and neutralize it. A chronically “leaky” gut may therefore drive LDL through the roof. On top of that, once the LDL binds with LPS, the endotoxin may affect the liver’s ability to dispose of these toxin-carrying particles, creating a double whammy of trouble.

There is a secret that the casinos possess, a secret they hold and guard and prize, the holiest of their mysteries. For most people do not gamble to win money, after all, although that is what is advertised, sold, claimed and dreamed. But that is merely the easy lie that allows the gamblers to lie to themselves, the big lie that gets them through the enormous, ever-open, welcoming doors. The secret is this: people gamble to lose money. They come to the casinos for the moment in which they feel alive, to ride the spinning wheel and turn with the cards and lose themselves, with the coins, in the slots. They want to know they matter. They may brag about the nights they won, the money they took from the casino, but they treasure, secretly treasure, the times they lost. It’s a sacrifice, of sorts.

People believe, thought Shadow. It’s what people do. They believe. And then they will not take responsibility for their beliefs; they conjure things, and do not trust the conjurations. People populate the darkness; with ghosts, with gods, with electrons, with tales. People imagine, and people believe: and it is that belief, that rock-solid belief, that makes things happen.

The philosophy asserts that virtue (meaning, chiefly, the four cardinal virtues of self-control, courage, justice, and wisdom) is happiness, and it is our perceptions of thingsrather than the things themselvesthat cause most of our trouble. Stoicism teaches that we can’t control or rely on anything outside what Epictetus called our “reasoned choice”our ability to use our reason to choose how we categorize, respond, and reorient ourselves to external events.

Land reform and the subsequent socialist laws implemented by the Nasserite regime stripped those families of their power and effectively blocked them from all avenues of engagement with society. A significant majority of those families, after decades of economic indulgence and sumptuous lifestyles, were too westernized, too detached, to remain in a changing country and to start afresh. The result was a notable wave of Christian emigration from Egypt, comprising those families that, a few years earlier, had been social luminaries in the country.

of the revolution on 25 January 2011 until President Mubarak stepped down on 11 February, ordinary Egyptians spontaneously carved out a distinctly national, secular narrative for the revolt; they adamantly rejected endorsing any religious or sectarian slogan; at times, Muslims and Christians in Tahrir Square took turns to pray in the protection of the other group, all united against the Mubarak regime. Even the majority of the Muslim Brotherhood members who, in the last week of the revolt, had formed a very significant presence in Tahrir Square, adhered to the overarching national rhetoric and feel.

What we consider to be harmless indulgences can easily become full-blown addictions. We start with coffee in the morning, and soon enough we can’t start the day without it. We check our email because it’s part of our job, and soon enough we feel the phantom buzz of the phone in our pocket every few seconds. Soon enough, these harmless habits are running our lives. The little compulsions and drives we have not only chip away at our freedom and sovereignty, they cloud our clarity. We think we’re in controlbut are we really? As one addict put it, addiction is when we’ve “lost the freedom to abstain.” Let us reclaim that freedom.

Seneca was an incredibly wealthy, even famous, manyet he was a Stoic. He had many material things, yet, as the Stoics say, he was also indifferent to them. He enjoyed them while they were there, but he accepted that they might someday disappear. What a better attitude than desperately craving more or fearfully dreading losing even one penny. Indifference is solid middle ground.

when it comes to the mind, we’re less disciplined. We hand it over willingly to social media, to television, to what other people are doing, thinking, or saying. We sit down to work and the next thing you know, we’re browsing the Internet. We sit down with our families, but within minutes we have our phones out. We sit down peacefully in a park, but instead of looking inward, we’re judging people as they pass by.

Governments like it that way. They want their people to see war as a drama of opposites, good and evil, ‘them’ and ‘us’, victory or defeat. But war is primarily not about victory or defeat but about death and the infliction of death. It represents the total failure of the human spirit.

Nations of the Soviet Union were born at a time of intense class struggle. The February Revolution in Petrograd provided the opportunity for nationalists in the borderlands to put themselves at the head of the peasant movement but, as the crisis deepened and the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia, nationalists had to face the competing demands of class and nation. In many areas  Ukraine, the Volga region, Azerbaijan and Central Asia  national differences intensified conflicts between town and country, although at times conflict took on a purely national character.

Most of these disputes concerned the respective powers of the Soviet Georgian government and the Federal Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of Transcaucasia, which had been formed from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia in March 1922. The Georgian government acted as if Georgia were a completely separate state, setting up border controls and setting ethnic criteria for citizenship, while the Kavburo sought to bring the security forces (the Cheka), army and economy of Georgia directly under its control. When it came to the proposal to incorporate Georgia, as part of the Transcaucasian Federation, into the USSR, the Georgian leaders complained vociferously but were dismissed out of hand by Lenin and other leaders.

Ethnographers adjudicated where there were competing claims, but so complex was the region that some anomalies resulted from the process, in some cases because of distortions created by the influence of local communists, but more often because within one small region distinct village communities existed alongside each other. A further complication was that much of the population, including most Kazakhs, were nomads with no fixed dwelling. Kazakh villages were left in Uzbekistan, Uzbeks found themselves on the Kyrgyz side of the border and so on. During the delimitation process itself, and in the months and years following its official completion in February 1925, the regional authorities and Moscow were inundated with complaints from communities complaining that they had ended up on the wrong side of the new borders.

Reformist Muslim intellectuals in the nineteenth century had supported transferring from the Arabic to the Latin alphabet, and Azerbaijan’s new leaders concurred on the basis that it would differentiate Azerbaijan from Turkey and Iran and strengthen ties with Russia, introducing the Latin alphabet from 1924, a move which the other Turkic republics reluctantly followed from 1928.

The disappearance of the livestock herds and growing pressure on grain supplies led to a horrific famine in Kazakhstan that lasted from 1931 to 1933.

Sedentarisation and collectivisation in Kazakhstan resulted not only in massive loss of life, but also destroyed a centuries-old way of life and the culture that was associated with it. While the famine appears to have been the result of incompetence and ill-thought-out implementation of drastic policies, the decision to sedentarise and the callousness of implementation underlined the new priorities of the regime. Not only did the economy come first, but also national development was no longer to be organic and was taken out of the hands of national communists.

12 The first full-length western study was Robert Conquest’s Harvest of Sorrow. Using demographic data, Conquest suggested at a conservative estimate that there were, in total, at least 13.5 million deaths as the result of the collectivisation and the 19321933 famine, although in a later edition of the book he raised this figure to 14.5 million deaths. Of these, he attributes about 6 million to the famine  5 million in Ukraine and 1 million in the North Caucasus.13 A further million, he estimated, died in the separate Kazakh famine. In a 1984 article, James E. Mace put the figures higher, at 7.5 million Ukrainians.14 Both the figures and, especially, the presumption that the famine was deliberate were challenged in 1991 by the economic historian Mark Tauger. From a reading of extensive data, Tauger argued that the harvest in 1932 was much lower than official figures suggested  so low that famine was unavoidable.15 In a subsequent exchange of letters between Conquest and Tauger, the battle-lines were drawn. In addition to disagreements over figures, questions were raised about the reliability of Soviet émigré accounts, reports that border guards prevented Ukrainians leaving or food being brought in, and the availability of food reserves which the regime might have used to relieve the famine.

In Georgia in 19511952 thousands of officials were purged and many arrested, including a large number of leaders of the Georgian Communist Party who came from the Mingrelian region, which was also the home base of Lavrenti Beria. Beria was then head of the security police of the USSR, but as the former boss of the Party organisations in the South Caucasus he had appointed many of the officials in Georgia and had shown a marked preference for fellow Mingrelians. The Mingrelian Affair, launched on Stalin’s own initiative, therefore seriously undermined Beria’s basis of support in Georgia at a time when Stalin was becoming suspicious of his growing power in Moscow.

The war transformed this relationship. The nationalities, like the Russians, emerged with a new sense of pride  much of it pride for the Soviet Union, but also national pride. The relaxation of ideological and cultural controls together with the sense that the sacrifice involved in victory over Hitler would lead to better times ahead fired a mood of expectation that the regime could only disappoint.

Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and how the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold. It steals up on you quieter than Will, and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires. It burns, it does. Nothing burns like the cold. But only for a while. Then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don’t have the strength to fight it. It’s easier just to sit down or go to sleep.

The arrest and removal of ethnic Germans had begun during Stalin’s Great Terror in 1937 when, with the prospect of a European war looming, the arrest of all Germans working in the military, chemicals, electricity and construction sectors was ordered. Further categories of Germans were added, and by the end of 1939 some 70,000 ethnic Germans had been arrested. Many of these were Soviet citizens, but this was a more targeted campaign, mostly against more recent arrivals in the USSR, and starting with those in sensitive industries.3 It is a clear indictment of the scale and horror of the later deportations that this exercise of Terror against 70,000 Germans appears relatively insignificant and even semi-rational.

First, the security of the Soviet state in what was perceived as an encirclement by hostile capitalist powers was a question of survival, and any possibility that internal forces might provide succour to external enemies provoked a harsh response. After all, one of Stalin’s closest associates Vyacheslav Molotov affirmed to the end of his days that the Great Terror of 19361938 was a justified response to the presence of traitors constituting a ‘fifth column’ in the Soviet rear at a time of impending war. The presence in the rear of a significant number of people who had already collaborated with the enemy was going to provoke an equally disproportionate response. Secondly, as discussed in Chapter 5, the Soviets had by now moved towards a far more rigid, primordial view of nationality than Lenin had held. It was a short step to associate particular nations with specific character traits. If the political or intellectual elites of a nationality had been prepared to betray the motherland and work for Hitler’s Nazis, how could the rest of that nation be trusted?

In 1864, after finally subjugating the North Caucasus, Tsar Alexander II’s government had deported large numbers of Cherkess, Chechens, Ossetians, Abkhaz and others to Turkey.9 The Circassians or Adyghes were expelled in their entirety from the empire. About two-thirds of the Tatar population of Crimea had already been forced into emigration under the Russian Empire. These measures had been intended to clear space for Russian settlers who would provide a loyal population, at the same time as breaking up nationalities whose hostility to Russian imperial rule posed, in the minds of the empire’s rulers, a threat to its stability.

One of the earlier reforms personally associated with Khrushchev had a profound impact on the demography and agriculture of Kazakhstan. Following the sedentarisation campaign of the 1930s, much of the land that had previously been used by nomads was no longer in agricultural use. This large area of unfarmed steppe, together with neighbouring regions of Siberia, became the target for the Virgin Lands campaign  an effort to get unused land under cultivation by bringing in thousands of settlers, mostly from Russia and Ukraine. From 1954, 42 million hectares of previously uncultivated land, most of it in northern Kazakhstan, was ploughed and sown. The initial economic benefits and later slump in agricultural output from the Virgin Lands were major factors in the fortunes of Khrushchev’s leadership, but they also had a drastic impact on nationality relations.

Tensions were at their highest in Tbilisi, where crowds converged on the Communist Party headquarters and also demanded to meet with a visiting leader of the Chinese Communist Party. Eventually, on the morning of 11 March, Red Army soldiers opened fire on demonstrators in Tbilisi, killing twenty.11 The shootings left a deep scar on a whole generation of Georgians, and resulted in an immediate increase in ethnic tensions between ethnic Georgians and Russians throughout the republic as well as a mistrust which lasted into the post-Soviet period.

The strongest reactions came in Lithuania, although here opposition was more covert than in Georgia. Nationalist graffiti became commonplace at Vilnius University and across the republic: ‘Long live the revolution in Hungary, let’s follow their example!’; ‘Lithuanians! Lithuania is for Lithuanians, Russians are occupiers, throw them out!’; ‘Give freedom to Lithuania’; ‘Let’s follow Hungary’s example’; ‘Down with communists’; ‘Russians, get out of Lithuania’. In Estonia similar sentiments were seen daubed on walls: ‘Death to the occupiers’; ‘Down with the Russian governors. Death to Russian occupiers. Throw the Russians out of Estonia’.

This was the sovnarkhoz (economic council) reform, which decentralised a large part of economic decision-making and supervision to regional councils. There was a political motive for this, as it involved the abolition or decimation of a number of central Moscow ministries, thus weakening the governmental structure that had acted as a rival to his own base, the CPSU, between 1953 and 1957. But there were also sound economic reasons for the reform. The centrally planned economy had ultimately proved effective at building up the Soviet Union’s industrial base in the 1930s and rebuilding it after the war, but did so at the cost of enormous waste and hardship. The costs and limitations of central planning were becoming more and more apparent as the possibilities of mobilising extra manpower and material began to diminish. The sovnarkhoz reform, by allowing more local decision-making and a degree of autonomy to factory directors, was supposed to overcome narrow departmentalism in the Moscow ministries,

In Georgia, protests by students, especially in Tbilisi, became a regular occurrence from the mid 1960s.33 Perhaps the best known, and certainly most successful, public protest took place in Georgia in 1978. A draft constitution of the Georgian SSR, prepared in conjunction with the discussions for a new constitution of the USSR, included Russian and other languages in addition to Georgian as the official languages of the republic. In response, following a petition campaign up to 5,000 people, mostly students, took to the streets in Tbilisi until First Secretary Shevardnadze announced that the proposal had been dropped. This apparent protest against a russifying move was in fact double-edged: the change would have strengthened the linguistic position of Georgia’s minorities  Abkhaz, Ossetians, Armenians and so on  who made up about a third of the population and did not speak Georgian as a first language. A series of demonstrations in Abkhazia in the same year, in part motivated by the victory of the Tbilisi demonstrators, won some concessions, but these fell short of the demand for separation from Georgia or equal status for the Abkhaz language.

The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh Andahli, the land of the Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms. Her brother had a simpler name. “Our land,” he called it. The words were like a prayer with him. If he said them enough, the gods were sure to hear. “Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours still, ours forever.

Occasionally I looked at the sky, where the stars were fading and the pink light of the morning was beginning to spread behind a dark bank of clouds. But my mind clung to my wife’s image, imagining it with an uncanny acuteness. I heard her answering me, saw her smile, her frank and encouraging look. Real or not, her look was then more luminous than the sun which was beginning to rise. A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truththat love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way an honorable wayin such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment.

If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber.

Marcus’s meditations are filled with self-criticism and so are the writings of other Stoics. It’s important to remember, however, that that’s as far as it goes. There was no self-flagellation, no paying penance, no self-esteem issues from guilt or self-loathing. You never hear them call themselves worthless pieces of crap, nor do they ever starve or cut themselves as punishment. Their self-criticism is constructive. Laying into yourself, unduly depriving yourself, punishing yourselfthat’s self-flagellation, not self-improvement.

We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer suffcient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedomsto choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.

Seen from this point of view, the mental reactions of the inmates of a concentration camp must seem more to us than the mere expression of certain physical and sociological conditions. Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insuffcient food and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of himmentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp. Dostoevski said once, “There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.” These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost. It can be said that they were worthy of their sufferings; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement. It is this spiritual freedomwhich cannot be taken awaythat makes life meaningful and purposeful.

A man who could not see the end of his “provisional existence” was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life. He ceased living for the future, in contrast to a man in normal life. Therefore the whole structure of his inner life changed; signs of decay set in which we know from other areas of life. The unemployed worker, for example, is in a similar position. His existence has become provisional and in a certain sense he cannot live for the future or aim at a goal. Research work done on unemployed miners has shown that they suffer from a peculiar sort of deformed timeinner timewhich is a result of their unemployed state. Prisoners, too, suffered from this strange “time-experience.” In camp, a small time unit, a day, for example, filled with hourly tortures and fatigue, appeared endless. A larger time unit, perhaps a week, seemed to pass very quickly. My comrades agreed when I said that in camp a day lasted longer than a week.

The fact is that a jumbo brain is a jumbo drain on the body. It’s not easy to carry around, especially when encased inside a massive skull. It’s even harder to fuel. In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 23 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per cent of rest-time energy. Archaic humans paid for their large brains in two ways. Firstly, they spent more time in search of food. Secondly, their muscles atrophied. Like a government diverting money from defence to education, humans diverted energy from biceps to neurons. It’s hardly a foregone conclusion that this is a good strategy for survival on the savannah. A chimpanzee can’t win an argument with a Homo sapiens, but the ape can rip the man apart like a rag doll

The opposing view, called the ‘Replacement Theory’ tells a very different story  one of incompatibility, revulsion, and perhaps even genocide. According to this theory, Sapiens and other humans had diʃerent anatomies, and most likely diʃerent mating habits and even body odours. They would have had little sexual interest in one another. And even if a Neanderthal Romeo and a Sapiens Juliet fell in love, they could not produce fertile children, because the genetic gulf separating the two populations was already unbridgeable

According to the Interbreeding Theory, when Sapiens spread into Neanderthal lands, Sapiens bred with Neanderthals until the two populations merged. If this is the case, then today’s Eurasians are not pure Sapiens. They are a mixture of Sapiens and Neanderthals. Similarly, when Sapiens reached East Asia, they interbred with the local Erectus, so the Chinese and Koreans are a mixture of Sapiens and Erectus

In recent decades the Replacement Theory has been the common wisdom in the ɹeld. It had ɹrmer archaeological backing, and was more politically correct (scientists had no desire to open up the Pandora’s box of racism by claiming signiɹcant genetic diversity among modern human populations). But that ended in 2010, when the results of a four-year eʃort to map the Neanderthal genome were published. Geneticists were able to collect enough intact Neanderthal DNA from fossils to make a broad comparison between it and the DNA of contemporary humans. The results stunned the scientific community. It turned out that 14 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern populations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. That’s not a huge amount, but it’s signiɹcant. A second shock came several months later, when DNA extracted from the fossilised ɹnger from Denisova was mapped. The results proved that up to 6 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians is Denisovan DNA. If these results are valid  and it’s important to keep in mind that further research is under way and may either reinforce or modify these conclusions  the Interbreeders got at least some things right. But that doesn’t mean that the Replacement Theory is completely wrong. Since Neanderthals and Denisovans contributed only a small amount of DNA to our present-day genome, it is impossible to speak of a ‘merger’ between Sapiens and other human species. Although diʃerences between them were not large enough to completely prevent fertile intercourse, they were sufficient to make such contacts very rare.

When two males are contesting the alpha position, they usually do so by forming extensive coalitions of supporters, both male and female, from within the group. Ties between coalition members are based on intimate daily contact  hugging, touching, kissing, grooming and mutual favours. Just as human politicians on election campaigns go around shaking hands and kissing babies, so aspirants to the top position in a chimpanzee group spend much time hugging, back-slapping and kissing baby chimps.

In the wake of the Cognitive Revolution, gossip helped Homo sapiens to form larger and more stable bands. But even gossip has its limits. Sociological research has shown that the maximum ‘natural’ size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. Most people can neither intimately know, nor gossip eʃectively about, more than 150 human beings. Even today, a critical threshold in human organisations falls somewhere around this magic number. Below this threshold, communities, businesses, social networks and military units can maintain themselves based mainly on intimate acquaintance and rumour-mongering. There is no need for formal ranks, titles and law books to keep order.

Peugeot is a ɹgment of our collective imagination. Lawyers call this a ‘legal ɹction’. It can’t be pointed at; it is not a physical object. But it exists as a legal entity. Just like you or me, it is bound by the laws of the countries in which it operates. It can open a bank account and own property. It pays taxes, and it can be sued and even prosecuted separately from any of the people who own or work for it.

In the US, the technical term for a limited liability company is a ‘corporation’, which is ironic, because the term derives from ‘corpus’ (‘body’ in Latin)  the one thing these corporations lack. Despite their having no real bodies, the American legal system treats corporations as legal persons, as if they were flesh-and-blood human beings.

Signiɹcant diʃerences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,0002,000 individuals, the diʃerences are astounding. If you tried to bunch together thousands of chimpanzees into Tiananmen Square, Wall Street, the Vatican or the headquarters of the United Nations, the result would be pandemonium. By contrast, Sapiens regularly gather by the thousands in such places. Together, they create orderly patterns  such as trade networks, mass celebrations and political institutions  that they could never have created in isolation. The real diʃerence between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation

Our eating habits, our conflicts and our sexuality are all the result of the way our hunter-gatherer minds interact with our current post-industrial environment, with its mega-cities, aeroplanes, telephones and computers. This environment gives us more material resources and longer lives than those enjoyed by any previous generation, but it often makes us feel alienated, depressed and pressured. To understand why, evolutionary psychologists argue, we need to delve into the hunter-gatherer world that shaped us, the world that we subconsciously still inhabit.

some evolutionary psychologists argue that ancient foraging bands were not composed of nuclear families centred on monogamous couples. Rather, foragers lived in communes devoid of private property, monogamous relationships and even fatherhood. In such a band, a woman could have sex and form intimate bonds with several men (and women) simultaneously, and all of the band’s adults cooperated in parenting its children. Since no man knew deɹnitively which of the children were his, men showed equal concern for all youngsters

It stands to reason that the ethnic and cultural variety among ancient huntergatherers was equally impressive, and that the 5 million to 8 million foragers who populated the world on the eve of the Agricultural Revolution were divided into thousands of separate tribes with thousands of diʃerent languages and cultures.3 This, after all, was one of the main legacies of the Cognitive Revolution. Thanks to the appearance of ɹction, even people with the same genetic make-up who lived under similar ecological conditions were able to create very diʃerent imagined realities, which manifested themselves in different norms and values.

The giant diprotodon appeared in Australia more than 1.5 million years ago and successfully weathered at least ten previous ice ages. It also survived the ɹrst peak of the last ice age, around 70,000 years ago. Why, then, did it disappear 45,000 years ago? Of course, if diprotodons had been the only large animal to disappear at this time, it might have been just a ɻuke. But more than 90 per cent of Australia’s megafauna disappeared along with the diprotodon. The evidence is circumstantial, but it’s hard to imagine that Sapiens, just by coincidence, arrived in Australia at the precise point that all these animals were dropping dead of the chills

Others might have been lured northwards by more positive reasons, such as animal protein. The Arctic lands were full of large, juicy animals such as reindeer and mammoths. Every mammoth was a source of a vast quantity of meat (which, given the frosty temperatures, could even be frozen for later use), tasty fat, warm fur and valuable ivory. As the ɹndings from Sungir testify, mammothhunters did not just survive in the frozen north  they thrived.

When the ɹrst Americans marched south from Alaska into the plains of Canada and the western United States, they encountered mammoths and mastodons, rodents the size of bears, herds of horses and camels, oversized lions and dozens of large species the likes of which are completely unknown today, among them fearsome sabre-tooth cats and giant ground sloths that weighed up to eight tons and reached a height of six metres. South America hosted an even more exotic menagerie of large mammals, reptiles and birds.

The transition to agriculture began around 95008500 BC in the hill country of south-eastern Turkey, western Iran, and the Levant. It began slowly and in a restricted geographical area. Wheat and goats were domesticated by approximately 9000 BC; peas and lentils around 8000 BC; olive trees by 5000 BC; horses by 4000 BC; and grapevines in 3500 BC. Some animals and plants, such as camels and cashew nuts, were domesticated even later, but by 3500 BC the main wave of domestication was over. Even today, with all our advanced technologies, more than 90 per cent of the calories that feed humanity come from the handful of plants that our ancestors domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC  wheat, rice, maize (called ‘corn’ in the US), potatoes, millet and barley.

Why did agricultural revolutions erupt in the Middle East, China and Central America but not in Australia, Alaska or South Africa? The reason is simple: most species of plants and animals can’t be domesticated. Sapiens could dig up delicious truʀes and hunt down woolly mammoths, but domesticating either species was out of the question. The fungi were far too elusive, the giant beasts too ferocious. Of the thousands of species that our ancestors hunted and gathered, only a few were suitable candidates for farming and herding.

There is no evidence that people became more intelligent with time. Foragers knew the secrets of nature long before the Agricultural Revolution, since their survival depended on an intimate knowledge of the animals they hunted and the plants they gathered. Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more diɽcult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud

Studies of ancient skeletons indicate that the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments, such as slipped discs, arthritis and hernias. Moreover, the new agricultural tasks demanded so much time that people were forced to settle permanently next to their wheat ɹelds. This completely changed their way of life. We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. The word ‘domesticate’ comes from the Latin domus, which means ‘house’. Who’s the one living in a house? Not the wheat. It’s the Sapiens

What then did wheat oʃer agriculturists, including that malnourished Chinese girl? It oʃered nothing for people as individuals. Yet it did bestow something on Homo sapiens as a species. Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory, and thereby enabled Homo sapiens to multiply exponentially. Around 13,000 BC, when people fed themselves by gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals, the area around the oasis of Jericho, in Palestine, could support at most one roaming band of about a hundred relatively healthy and well-nourished people. Around 8500 BC, when wild plants gave way to wheat ɹelds, the oasis supported a large but cramped village of 1,000 people, who suʃered far more from disease and malnourishment

About 18,000 years ago, the last ice age gave way to a period of global warming. As temperatures rose, so did rainfall. The new climate was ideal for Middle Eastern wheat and other cereals, which multiplied and spread. People began eating more wheat, and in exchange they inadvertently spread its growth. Since it was impossible to eat wild grains without ɹrst winnowing, grinding and cooking them, people who gathered these grains carried them back to their temporary campsites for processing. Wheat grains are small and numerous, so some of them inevitably fell on the way to the campsite and were lost. Over time, more and more wheat grew along favourite human trails and near campsites. When humans burned down forests and thickets, this also helped wheat. Fire cleared away trees and shrubs, allowing wheat and other grasses to monopolise the sunlight, water and nutrients. Where wheat became particularly abundant, and game and other food sources were also plentiful, human bands could gradually give up their nomadic lifestyle and settle down in seasonal and even permanent camps

The natural lifespan of wild chickens is about seven to twelve years, and of cattle about twenty to twenty-ɹve years. In the wild, most chickens and cattle died long before that, but they still had a fair chance of living for a respectable number of years. In contrast, the vast majority of domesticated chickens and cattle are slaughtered at the age of between a few weeks and a few months, because this has always been the optimal slaughtering age from an economic perspective. (Why keep feeding a cock for three years if it has already reached its maximum weight after three months?) Egg-laying hens, dairy cows and draught animals are sometimes allowed to live for many years. But the price is subjugation to a way of life completely alien to their urges and desires. It’s reasonable to assume, for example, that bulls prefer to spend their days wandering over open prairies in the company of other bulls and cows rather than pulling carts and ploughshares under the yoke of a whipwielding ape. In order to turn bulls, horses, donkeys and camels into obedient draught animals, their natural instincts and social ties had to be broken, their aggression and sexuality contained, and their freedom of movement curtailed. Farmers developed techniques such as locking animals inside pens and cages, bridling them in harnesses and leashes, training them with whips and cattle prods, and mutilating them. The process of taming almost always involves the castration of males. This restrains male aggression and enables humans selectively to control the herd’s procreation

In many New Guinean societies, the wealth of a person has traditionally been determined by the number of pigs he or she owns. To ensure that the pigs can’t run away, farmers in northern New Guinea slice oʃ a chunk of each pig’s nose. This causes severe pain whenever the pig tries to sniʃ. Since the pigs cannot ɹnd food or even ɹnd their way around without sniɽng, this mutilation makes them completely dependent on their human owners. In another area of New Guinea, it has been customary to gouge out pigs’ eyes, so that they cannot even see where they’re going.

modern calf in an industrial meat farm. Immediately after birth the calf is separated from its mother and locked inside a tiny cage not much bigger than the calf’s own body. There the calf spends its entire life  about four months on average. It never leaves its cage, nor is it allowed to play with other calves or even walk  all so that its muscles will not grow strong. Soft muscles mean a soft and juicy steak. The first time the calf has a chance to walk, stretch its muscles and touch other calves is on its way to the slaughterhouse. In evolutionary terms, cattle represent one of the most successful animal species ever to exist. At the same time, they are some of the most miserable animals on the planet.

Partial script, on the other hand, is a system of material signs that can represent only particular types of information, belonging to a limited ɹeld of activity. Latin script, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and Braille are full scripts. You can use them to write tax registers, love poems, history books, food recipes and business law.

This partial script was composed of ten signs, representing the numbers from 0 to 9. Confusingly, these signs are known as Arabic numerals even though they were ɹrst invented by the Hindus (even more confusingly, modern Arabs use a set of digits that look quite diʃerent from Western ones). But the Arabs get the credit because when they invaded India they encountered the system, understood its usefulness, reɹned it, and spread it through the Middle East and then to Europe. When several other signs were later added to the Arab numerals (such as the signs for addition, subtraction and multiplication), the basis of modern mathematical notation came into being.

The reaction is quite natural, and does not betray a lack of intelligence or curiosity. With rare exceptions, human brains are simply incapable of thinking through concepts like relativity and quantum mechanics. Physicists nevertheless manage to do so, because they set aside the traditional human way of thinking, and learn to think anew with the help of external data-processing systems.

Most people claim that their social hierarchy is natural and just, while those of other societies are based on false and ridiculous criteria. Modern Westerners are taught to scoʃ at the idea of racial hierarchy. They are shocked by laws prohibiting blacks to live in white neighbourhoods, or to study in white schools, or to be treated in white hospitals. But the hierarchy of rich and poor  which mandates that rich people live in separate and more luxurious neighbourhoods, study in separate and more prestigious schools, and receive medical treatment in separate and better-equipped facilities  seems perfectly sensible to many Americans and Europeans. Yet it’s a proven fact that most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people will remain poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor family.

Of course, diʃerences in natural abilities also play a role in the formation of social distinctions. But such diversities of aptitudes and character are usually mediated through imagined hierarchies. This happens in two important ways. First and foremost, most abilities have to be nurtured and developed. Even if somebody is born with a particular talent, that talent will usually remain latent if it is not fostered, honed and exercised. Not all people get the same chance to cultivate and reɹne their abilities. Whether or not they have such an opportunity will usually depend on their place within their society’s imagined hierarchy. Harry Potter is a good example. Removed from his distinguished wizard family and brought up by ignorant muggles, he arrives at Hogwarts without any experience in magic. It takes him seven books to gain a ɹrm command of his powers and knowledge of his unique abilities. Second, even if people belonging to diʃerent classes develop exactly the same abilities, they are unlikely to enjoy equal success because they will have to play the game by diʃerent rules. If, in British-ruled India, an Untouchable, a Brahmin, a Catholic Irishman and a Protestant Englishman had somehow developed exactly the same business acumen, they still would not have had the same chance of becoming rich. The economic game was rigged by legal restrictions and unoɽcial glass ceilings

similar vicious circle perpetuated the racial hierarchy in modern America. From the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, the European conquerors imported millions of African slaves to work the mines and plantations of America. They chose to import slaves from Africa rather than from Europe or East Asia due to three circumstantial factors. Firstly, Africa was closer, so it was cheaper to import slaves from Senegal than from Vietnam. Secondly, in Africa there already existed a well-developed slave trade (exporting slaves mainly to the Middle East), whereas in Europe slavery was very rare. It was obviously far easier to buy slaves in an existing market than to create a new one from scratch. Thirdly, and most importantly, American plantations in places such as Virginia, Haiti and Brazil were plagued by malaria and yellow fever, which had originated in Africa. Africans had acquired over the generations a partial genetic immunity to these diseases, whereas Europeans were totally defenceless and died in droves. It was consequently wiser for a plantation owner to invest his money in an African slave than in a European slave or indentured labourer. Paradoxically, genetic superiority (in terms of immunity) translated into social inferiority: precisely because Africans were ɹtter in tropical climates than Europeans, they

You might think that people would gradually understand that these stigmas were myth rather than fact and that blacks would be able, over time, to prove themselves just as competent, law-abiding and clean as whites. In fact, the opposite happened  these prejudices became more and more entrenched as time went by. Since all the best jobs were held by whites, it became easier to believe that blacks really are inferior. ‘Look,’ said the average white citizen, ‘blacks have been free for generations, yet there are almost no black professors, lawyers, doctors or even bank tellers. Isn’t that proof that blacks are simply less intelligent and hard-working?’ Trapped in this vicious circle, blacks were not hired for whitecollar jobs because they were deemed unintelligent, and the proof of their inferiority was the paucity of blacks in white-collar jobs

Money enables people to compare quickly and easily the value of diʃerent commodities (such as apples, shoes and divorces), to easily exchange one thing for another, and to store wealth conveniently. There have been many types of money. The most familiar is the coin, which is a standardised piece of imprinted metal. Yet money existed long before the invention of coinage, and cultures have prospered using other things as currency, such as shells, cattle, skins, salt, grain, beads, cloth and promissory notes. Cowry shells were used as money for about 4,000 years all over Africa, South Asia, East Asia and Oceania. Taxes could still be paid in cowry shells in British Uganda in the early twentieth century

Trust is the raw material from which all types of money are minted. When a wealthy farmer sold his possessions for a sack of cowry shells and travelled with them to another province, he trusted that upon reaching his destination other people would be willing to sell him rice, houses and ɹelds in exchange for the shells. Money is accordingly a system of mutual trust, and not just any system of mutual trust: money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.

The real breakthrough in monetary history occurred when people gained trust in money that lacked inherent value, but was easier to store and transport. Such money appeared in ancient Mesopotamia in the middle of the third millennium BC. This was the silver shekel. The silver shekel was not a coin, but rather 8.33 grams of silver. When Hammurabi’s Code declared that a superior man who killed a slave woman must pay her owner twenty silver shekels, it meant that he had to pay 166 grams of silver, not twenty coins

That’s why counterfeiting money has always been considered a much more serious crime than other acts of deception. Counterfeiting is not just cheating  it’s a breach of sovereignty, an act of subversion against the power, privileges and person of the king. The legal term is lese-majesty (violating majesty), and was typically punished by torture and death. As long as people trusted the power and integrity of the king, they trusted his coins.

Merchants travelling between India and the Mediterranean would notice the diʃerence in the value of gold. In order to make a proɹt, they would buy gold cheaply in India and sell it dearly in the Mediterranean. Consequently, the demand for gold in India would skyrocket, as would its value. At the same time the Mediterranean would experience an inɻux of gold, whose value would consequently drop. Within a short time the value of gold in India and the Mediterranean would be quite similar. The mere fact that Mediterranean people believed in gold would cause Indians to start believing in it as well. Even if Indians still had no real use for gold, the fact that Mediterranean people wanted it would be enough to make the Indians value it.

Nevertheless, the modern Indian state is a child of the British Empire. The British killed, injured and persecuted the inhabitants of the subcontinent, but they also united a bewildering mosaic of warring kingdoms, principalities and tribes, creating a shared national consciousness and a country that functioned more or less as a single political unit. They laid the foundations of the Indian judicial system, created its administrative structure, and built the railroad network that was critical for economic integration. Independent India adopted Western democracy, in its British incarnation, as its form of government. English is still the subcontinent’s lingua franca, a neutral tongue that native speakers of Hindi, Tamil and Malayalam can use to communicate. Indians are passionate cricket players and chai (tea) drinkers, and both game and beverage are British legacies.

Religion can thus be deɹned as a system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in a superhuman order. This involves two distinct criteria: 1. Religions hold that there is a superhuman order, which is not the product of human whims or agreements. Professional football is not a religion, because despite its many laws, rites and often bizarre rituals, everyone knows that human beings invented football themselves, and FIFA may at any moment enlarge the size of the goal or cancel the offside rule. 2. Based on this superhuman order, religion establishes norms and values that it considers binding.

A leading theory about the origin of the gods argues that gods gained importance because they oʃered a solution to this problem. Gods such as the fertility goddess, the sky god and the god of medicine took centre stage when plants and animals lost their ability to speak, and the gods’ main role was to mediate between humans and the mute plants and animals. Much of ancient mythology is in fact a legal contract in which humans promise everlasting devotion to the gods in exchange for mastery over plants and animals  the ɹrst chapters of the book of Genesis are a prime example.

The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts. Scholars of religion have a name for this simultaneous avowal of diʃerent and even contradictory ideas and the combination of rituals and practices taken from diʃerent sources. It’s called syncretism. Syncretism might, in fact, be the single great world religion.

product of natural laws rather than of divine wills and whims. Some of these natural-law religions continued to espouse the existence of gods, but their gods were subject to the laws of nature no less than humans, animals and plants were. Gods had their niche in the ecosystem, just as elephants and porcupines had theirs, but could no more change the laws of nature than elephants can. A prime example is Buddhism, the most important of the ancient natural law religions, which remains one of the major faiths.

In the end he came to the realisation that suʃering is not caused by ill fortune, by social injustice, or by divine whims. Rather, suʃering is caused by the behaviour patterns of one’s own mind. Gautama’s insight was that no matter what the mind experiences, it usually reacts with craving, and craving always involves dissatisfaction. When the mind experiences something distasteful it craves to be rid of the irritation. When the mind experiences something pleasant, it craves that the pleasure will remain and will intensify. Therefore, the mind is always dissatisɹed and restless

If, when the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things as they are, then there is no suʃering. If you experience sadness without craving that the sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness but you do not suʃer from it. There can actually be richness in the sadness. If you experience joy without craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without losing your peace of mind.

But if we take into consideration natural-law religions, then modernity turns out to be an age of intense religious fervour, unparalleled missionary eʃorts, and the bloodiest wars of religion in history. The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. These creeds do not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies. But this is just a semantic exercise. If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam.

What these two  Aliev and Shevardnadze  shared was the rare distinction of being non-Slavs who achieved promotion to the CPSU Politburo in the years between Khrushchev and Gorbachev. For most republican leaders, it appeared that during the Brezhnev years there was a glass ceiling which, while allowing them to rule with relatively little interference over their own republics, meant they were always subject to the whims of the Kremlin and could never achieve higher office.

By the end of the Brezhnev era, each capital was home to at least one of each of the buildings typical of European capital cities  an opera house, a state theatre, national museum and so on, as well as Supreme Soviet and other government buildings. By 1984, while Russia boasted only two metro systems (Moscow and St Petersburg), metros had been opened in Kiev, Tbilisi, Kharkiv, Baku, Tashkent, Yerevan and Minsk  in that order, which also gives an indication of the relative importance of each republic in official eyes. As well as the physical infrastructure, each republic enjoyed a full set of its own artistic and academic institutions  an Academy of Sciences, a Union of Writers, a Union of Artists and so on. With the partial exception of Ukraine, where separate regional centres can be identified, these national infrastructural and institutional developments were concentrated in the capital cities, which also became the focus for road, rail and air communications.

by the 1980s each republic was led by a national ruling elite, had a distinctive and flourishing national intelligentsia, both official and dissident, was teaching national history in schools (after 1960) and was centred on a capital city that held most of the characteristics and infrastructure of the capital of an independent European country. The extent to which this held true varied considerably between republics  Minsk, for example, was an increasingly russified city, while national development perhaps went furthest in the three South Caucasian republics.

The second pressure came from opportunities for social and geographical mobility, which rested on a command of Russian. The predominance of Russian in higher education in most republics (Azerbaijan was a notable exception) and the availability of senior party posts as well as technical and managerial roles only to Russian speakers provided a strong incentive for parents to send their children to Russian-language schools. It was this pressure that Khrushchev had hoped to capitalise on with his 1958 school reform.

history is what is called a ‘level two’ chaotic system. Chaotic systems come in two shapes. Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it. The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic system. Though it is inɻuenced by myriad factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts. Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic system. What will happen if we develop a computer program that forecasts with 100 per cent accuracy the price of oil tomorrow? The price of oil will immediately react to the forecast, which would consequently fail to materialise. If the current price of oil is $90 a barrel, and the infallible computer program predicts that tomorrow it will be $100, traders will rush to buy oil so that they can proɹt from the predicted price rise. As a result, the price will shoot up to $100 a barrel today rather than tomorrow.

We study history not to know the future but to widen our horizons, to understand that our present situation is neither natural nor inevitable, and that we consequently have many more possibilities before us than we imagine.

Ever more scholars see cultures as a kind of mental infection or parasite, with humans as its unwitting host. Organic parasites, such as viruses, live inside the body of their hosts. They multiply and spread from one host to the other, feeding oʃ their hosts, weakening them, and sometimes even killing them. As long as the hosts live long enough to pass along the parasite, it cares little about the condition of its host. In just this fashion, cultural ideas live inside the minds of humans. They multiply and spread from one host to another, occasionally weakening the hosts and sometimes even killing them. A cultural idea  such as belief in Christian heaven above the clouds or Communist paradise here on earth  can compel a human to dedicate his or her life to spreading that idea, even at the price of death. The human dies, but the idea spreads. According to this approach, cultures are not conspiracies concocted by some people in order to take advantage of others (as Marxists tend to think). Rather, cultures are mental parasites that emerge accidentally, and thereafter take advantage of all people infected by them

It was a mysterious ailment called scurvy. Men who came down with the disease grew lethargic and depressed, and their gums and other soft tissues bled. As the disease progressed, their teeth fell out, open sores appeared and they grew feverish, jaundiced, and lost control of their limbs. Between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, scurvy is estimated to have claimed the lives of about 2 million sailors. No one knew what caused it, and no matter what remedy was tried, sailors continued to die in droves. The turning point came in 1747, when a British physician, James Lind, conducted a controlled experiment on sailors who suʃered from the disease. He separated them into several groups and gave each group a diʃerent treatment. One of the test groups was instructed to eat citrus fruits, a common folk remedy for scurvy. The patients in this group promptly recovered. Lind did not know what the citrus fruits had that the sailors’ bodies lacked, but we now know that it is vitamin C. A typical shipboard diet at that time was notably lacking in foods that are rich in this essential nutrient. On long-range voyages sailors usually subsisted on biscuits and beef jerky, and ate almost no fruits or vegetables.

The Royal Navy was not convinced by Lind’s experiments, but James Cook was. He resolved to prove the doctor right. He loaded his boat with a large quantity of sauerkraut and ordered his sailors to eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables whenever the expedition made landfall. Cook did not lose a single sailor to scurvy. In the following decades, all the world’s navies adopted Cook’s nautical diet, and the lives of countless sailors and passengers were saved.

Europe’s scientists are often given much of the credit. It’s unquestionable that from 1850 onward European domination rested to a large extent on the militaryindustrialscientiɹc complex and technological wizardry. All successful late modern empires cultivated scientiɹc research in the hope of harvesting technological innovations, and many scientists spent most of their time working on arms, medicines and machines for their imperial masters. A common saying among European soldiers facing African enemies was, ‘Come what may, we have machine guns, and they don’t.’ Civilian technologies were no less important. Canned food fed soldiers, railroads and steamships transported soldiers and their provisions, while a new arsenal of medicines cured soldiers, sailors and locomotive engineers. These logistical advances played a more signiɹcant role in the European conquest of Africa than did the machine gun

European imperialism was entirely unlike all other imperial projects in history. Previous seekers of empire tended to assume that they already understood the world. Conquest merely utilised and spread their view of the world. The Arabs, to name one example, did not conquer Egypt, Spain or India in order to discover something they did not know. The Romans, Mongols and Aztecs voraciously conquered new lands in search of power and wealth  not of knowledge. In contrast, European imperialists set out to distant shores in the hope of obtaining new knowledge along with new territories

Next, British, French and German scholars wedded the linguistic theory about the industrious Aryans to Darwin’s theory of natural selection and posited that the Aryans were not just a linguistic group but a biological entity  a race. And not just any race, but a master race of tall, light-haired, blue-eyed, hard-working, and super-rational humans who emerged from the mists of the north to lay the foundations of culture throughout the world. Regrettably, the Aryans who invaded India and Persia intermarried with the local natives they found in these lands, losing their light complexions and blond hair, and with them their rationality and diligence. The civilisations of India and Persia consequently declined. In Europe, on the other hand, the Aryans preserved their racial purity.

The secret of Dutch success was credit. The Dutch burghers, who had little taste for combat on land, hired mercenary armies to ɹght the Spanish for them. The Dutch themselves meanwhile took to the sea in ever-larger ɻeets. Mercenary armies and cannon-brandishing ɻeets cost a fortune, but the Dutch were able to ɹnance their military expeditions more easily than the mighty Spanish Empire because they secured the trust of the burgeoning European ɹnancial system at a time when the Spanish king was carelessly eroding its trust in him. Financiers extended the Dutch enough credit to set up armies and ɻeets, and these armies and ɻeets gave the Dutch control of world trade routes, which in turn yielded handsome proɹts. The proɹts allowed the Dutch to repay the loans, which strengthened the trust of the ɹnanciers. Amsterdam was fast becoming not only one of the most important ports of Europe, but also the continent’s ɹnancial Mecca.

While VOC operated in the Indian Ocean, the Dutch West Indies Company, or WIC, plied the Atlantic. In order to control trade on the important Hudson River, WIC built a settlement called New Amsterdam on an island at the river’s mouth. The colony was threatened by Indians and repeatedly attacked by the British, who eventually captured it in 1664. The British changed its name to New York.

The behaviour of the French crown was particularly notorious during what was called the Mississippi Bubble, the largest ɹnancial crisis of eighteenth-century Europe. That story also begins with an empire-building joint-stock company. In 1717 the Mississippi Company, chartered in France, set out to colonise the lower Mississippi valley, establishing the city of New Orleans in the process. To finance its ambitious plans, the company, which had good connections at the court of King Louis XV, sold shares on the Paris stock exchange. John Law, the company’s director, was also the governor of the central bank of France. Furthermore, the king had appointed him controller-general of ɹnances, an oɽce roughly equivalent to that of a modern ɹnance minister. In 1717 the lower Mississippi valley oʃered few attractions besides swamps and alligators, yet the Mississippi Company spread tales of fabulous riches and boundless opportunities. French aristocrats, businessmen and the stolid members of the urban bourgeoisie fell for these fantasies, and Mississippi share prices skyrocketed

Some speculators realised that the share prices were totally unrealistic and unsustainable. They figured that they had better sell while stock prices were at their peak. As the supply of shares available rose, their price declined. When other investors saw the price going down, they also wanted to get out quick. The stock price plummeted further, setting oʃ an avalanche. In order to stabilise prices, the central bank of France  at the direction of its governor, John Law  bought up Mississippi shares, but it could not do so for ever. Eventually it ran out of money. When this happened, the controller-general of finances, the same John Law, authorised the printing of more money in order to buy additional shares. This placed the entire French ɹnancial system inside the bubble. And not even this ɹnancial wizardry could save the day. The price of Mississippi shares dropped from 10,000 livres back to 1,000 livres, and then collapsed completely, and the shares lost every sou of their worth. By now, the central bank and the royal treasury owned a huge amount of worthless stock and had no money. The big speculators emerged largely unscathed  they had sold in time. Small investors lost everything, and many committed suicide.

While the British could borrow money easily and at low interest rates, France had diɽculties securing loans, and had to pay high interest on them. In order to ɹnance his growing debts, the king of France borrowed more and more money at higher and higher interest rates. Eventually, in the 1780s, Louis XVI, who had ascended to the throne on his grandfather’s death, realised that half his annual budget was tied to servicing the interest on his loans, and that he was heading towards bankruptcy. Reluctantly, in 1789, Louis XVI convened the Estates General, the French parliament that had not met for a century and a half, in order to ɹnd a solution to the crisis. Thus began the French Revolution. While the French overseas empire was crumbling, the British Empire was expanding rapidly. Like the Dutch Empire before it, the British Empire was established and run largely by private joint-stock companies based in the London stock exchange. The ɹrst English settlements in North America were established in the early seventeenth century by joint-stock companies such as the London Company, the Plymouth Company, the Dorchester Company and the Massachusetts Company

The most notorious example of how governments did the bidding of big money was the First Opium War, fought between Britain and China (184042). In the ɹrst half of the nineteenth century, the British East India Company and sundry British business people made fortunes by exporting drugs, particularly opium, to China. Millions of Chinese became addicts, debilitating the country both economically and socially. In the late 1830s the Chinese government issued a ban on drug traɽcking, but British drug merchants simply ignored the law. Chinese authorities began to conɹscate and destroy drug cargos. The drug cartels had close connections in Westminster and Downing Street  many MPs and Cabinet ministers in fact held stock in the drug companies  so they pressured the government to take action. In 1840 Britain duly declared war on China in the name of ‘free trade’. It was a walkover. The overconɹdent Chinese were no match for Britain’s new wonder weapons  steamboats, heavy artillery, rockets and rapid-ɹre riɻes. Under the subsequent peace treaty, China agreed not to constrain the activities of British drug merchants and to compensate them for damages inɻicted by the Chinese police. Furthermore, the British demanded and received control of Hong Kong, which they proceeded to use as a secure base for drug traɽcking (Hong Kong remained in British hands until 1997). In the late nineteenth century, about 40 million Chinese, a tenth of the country’s population, were opium addicts

This is why today a country’s credit rating is far more important to its economic well-being than are its natural resources. Credit ratings indicate the probability that a country will pay its debts. In addition to purely economic data, they take into account political, social and even cultural factors. An oil-rich country cursed with a despotic government, endemic warfare and a corrupt judicial system will usually receive a low credit rating. As a result, it is likely to remain relatively poor since it will not be able to raise the necessary capital to make the most of its oil bounty. A country devoid of natural resources, but which enjoys peace, a fair judicial system and a free government is likely to receive a high credit rating. As such, it may be able to raise enough cheap capital to support a good education system and foster a flourishing high-tech industry

What happens if farmers now take a young calf, separate her from her mother, put her in a closed cage, give her food, water and inoculations against diseases, and then, when she is old enough, inseminate her with bull sperm? From an objective perspective, this calf no longer needs either maternal bonding or playmates in order to survive and reproduce. But from a subjective perspective, the calf still feels a very strong urge to bond with her mother and to play with other calves. If these urges are not fulɹlled, the calf suʃers greatly. This is the basic lesson of evolutionary psychology: a need shaped in the wild continues to be felt subjectively even if it is no longer really necessary for survival and reproduction.

Humankind really has taken over the world.1 Ecological degradation is not the same as resource scarcity. As we saw in the previous chapter, the resources available to humankind are constantly increasing, and are likely to continue to do so. That’s why doomsday prophesies of resource scarcity are probably misplaced. In contrast, the fear of ecological degradation is only too well founded. The future may see Sapiens gaining control of a cornucopia of new materials and energy sources, while simultaneously destroying what remains of the natural habitat and driving most other species to extinction

18 A Permanent Revolution THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION OPENED up new ways to convert energy and to produce goods, largely liberating humankind from its dependence on the surrounding ecosystem. Humans cut down forests, drained swamps, dammed rivers, ɻooded plains, laid down tens of thousands of kilometres of railroad tracks, and built skyscraping metropolises. As the world was moulded to ɹt the needs of Homo sapiens, habitats were destroyed and species went extinct. Our once green and blue planet is becoming a concrete and plastic shopping centre. Today, the earths continents are home to almost 7 billion Sapiens. If you took all these people and put them on a large set of scales, their combined mass would be about 300 million tons. If you then took all our domesticated farmyard animals  cows, pigs, sheep and chickens  and placed them on an even larger set of scales, their mass would amount to about 700 million tons.

Nature cannot be destroyed. Sixty-ɹve million years ago, an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, but in so doing opened the way forward for mammals. Today, humankind is driving many species into extinction and might even annihilate itself. But other organisms are doing quite well. Rats and cockroaches, for example, are in their heyday. These tenacious creatures would probably creep out from beneath the smoking rubble of a nuclear Armageddon, ready and able to spread their DNA. Perhaps 65 million years from now, intelligent rats will look back gratefully on the decimation wrought by humankind, just as we today can thank that dinosaur-busting asteroid

However, in a modern footwear-factory assembly line, every worker mans a machine that produces just a small part of a shoe, which is then passed on to the next machine. If the worker who operates machine no. 5 has overslept, it stalls all the other machines. In order to prevent such calamities, everybody must adhere to a precise timetable. Each worker arrives at work at exactly the same time. Everybody takes their lunch break together, whether they are hungry or not. Everybody goes home when a whistle announces that the shift is over  not when they have ɹnished their project.

The community oʃered help on the basis of local traditions and an economy of favours, which often diʃered greatly from the supply and demand laws of the free market. In an old-fashioned medieval community, when my neighbour was in need, I helped build his hut and guard his sheep, without expecting any payment in return. When I was in need, my neighbour returned the favour. At the same time, the local potentate might have drafted all of us villagers to construct his castle without paying us a penny. In exchange, we counted on him to defend us against brigands and barbarians. Village life involved many transactions but few payments. There were some markets, of course, but their roles were limited. You could buy rare spices, cloth and tools, and hire the services of lawyers and doctors. Yet less than 10 per cent of commonly used products and services were bought in the market. Most human needs were taken care of by the family and the community

They exist only in our collective imagination, yet their power is immense.

Compare a medieval French peasant to a modern Parisian banker. The peasant lived in an unheated mud hut overlooking the local pigsty, while the banker goes home to a splendid penthouse with all the latest technological gadgets and a view to the Champs-Elysées. Intuitively, we would expect the banker to be much happier than the peasant. However, mud huts, penthouses and the ChampsElysées don’t really determine our mood. Serotonin does. When the medieval peasant completed the construction of his mud hut, his brain neurons secreted serotonin, bringing it up to level X. When in 2014 the banker made the last payment on his wonderful penthouse, brain neurons secreted a similar amount of serotonin, bringing it up to a similar level X. It makes no diʃerence to the brain that the penthouse is far more comfortable than the mud hut. The only thing that matters is that at present the level of serotonin is X. Consequently the banker would not be one iota happier than his great-great-great-grandfather, the poor medieval peasant

The problem, according to Buddhism, is that our feelings are no more than ɻeeting vibrations, changing every moment, like the ocean waves. If ɹve minutes ago I felt joyful and purposeful, now these feelings are gone, and I might well feel sad and dejected. So if I want to experience pleasant feelings, I have to constantly chase them, while driving away the unpleasant feelings. Even if I succeed, I immediately have to start all over again, without ever getting any lasting reward for my troubles.

According to Buddhism, the root of suʃering is neither the feeling of pain nor of sadness nor even of meaninglessness. Rather, the real root of suʃering is this never-ending and pointless pursuit of ephemeral feelings, which causes us to be in a constant state of tension, restlessness and dissatisfaction. Due to this pursuit, the mind is never satisɹed. Even when experiencing pleasure, it is not content, because it fears this feeling might soon disappear, and craves that this feeling should stay and intensify

Buddha agreed with modern biology and New Age movements that happiness is independent of external conditions. Yet his more important and far more profound insight was that true happiness is also independent of our inner feelings. Indeed, the more signiɹcance we give our feelings, the more we crave them, and the more we suʃer. Buddha’s recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings

In the following millennia it transformed itself into the master of the entire planet and the terror of the ecosystem. Today it stands on the verge of becoming a god, poised to acquire not only eternal youth, but also the divine abilities of creation and destruction. Unfortunately, the Sapiens regime on earth has so far produced little that we can be proud of. We have mastered our surroundings, increased food production, built cities, established empires and created far-ɻung trade networks. But did we decrease the amount of suʃering in the world? Time and again, massive increases in human power did not necessarily improve the well-being of individual Sapiens, and usually caused immense misery to other animals. In the last few decades we have at last made some real progress as far as the human condition is concerned, with the reduction of famine, plague and war. Yet the situation of other animals is deteriorating more rapidly than ever before, and the improvement in the lot of humanity is too recent and fragile to be certain of. Moreover, despite the astonishing things that humans are capable of doing, we remain unsure of our goals and we seem to be as discontented as ever. We have advanced from canoes to galleys to steamships to space shuttles  but nobody knows where we’re going. We are more powerful than ever before, but have very little idea what to do with all that power. Worse still, humans seem to be more irresponsible than ever. Self-made gods with only the laws of physics to keep us company, we are accountable to no one.

Graham stated that it seems “ridiculously simple to say” that if one could buy a group of 20 or 30 companies that were cheap enough to meet the strict requirements of his formula, without doing any further analysis, the “results should be quite satisfactory. ” In fact, Graham used this formula with much success for over 30 years.

Often, small companies have very few shares available for purchase, and even a small amount of demand for those shares can push share prices higher. If that’s the case, the formula may look great on paper, but in the real world, the fantastic results can’t be replicated. That’s why it’s important that the companies chosen by the magic formula be pretty large. Last chapter, the magic formula ranked 3,500 of the largest companies available for trading on the major U.S. stock exchanges. The formula then chose its favorite stocks from that group. Even the very smallest of those 3,500 companies still had a market value (the number of shares times the stock price) of over $50 million.* With * See Appendix section for details

this strategy won’t help you beat the market, it will help you achieve returns that are at least close to the market averages.*Since, after taking into account fees and other costs, most other investment choices leave you with much lower returns than index funds, many people who have carefully studied the issue have concluded that settling for average returns is actually a pretty good alternative.

For individual stocks in which we are showing a loss from our initial purchase price, we will want to sell a few days before our one-year holding period is up. For those stocks with a gain, we will want to sell a day or two after the one-year period is up. In that way, all of our gains will receive the advantages of the lower tax rate afforded to long-term capital gains (a maximum 15 percent tax rate under federal guidelines for stocks held more than one year), and all of our losses will receive short-term tax treatment (a deduction against other sources of income that otherwise could have been taxable at rates up to 35 percent).

Graham developed his core principles, which are at least as valid today as they were during his lifetime: A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value that does not depend on its share price. The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists. The future value of every investment is a function of its present price. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be. No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever eliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what Graham called the “margin of safety”never overpaying, no matter how exciting an investment seems to becan you minimize your odds of error. The secret to your financial success is inside yourself. If you become a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street “fact” on faith, and you invest with patient confidence, you can take steady advantage of even the worst bear markets. By developing your discipline and courage, you can refuse to let other people’s mood swings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your investments behave is much less important than how you behave.

shall suggest as one of our chief requirements here that our readers limit themselves to issues selling not far above their tangible-asset value.* The reason for this seemingly outmoded counsel is both practical and psychological. Experience has taught us that, while there are many good growth companies worth several times net assets, the buyer of such shares will be too dependent on the vagaries and fluctuations of the stock market. By contrast, the investor in shares, say, of public-utility companies at about their net-asset value can always consider himself the owner of an interest in sound and expanding businesses, acquired at a rational priceregardless of what the stock market might say to the contrary. The ultimate result of such a conservative policy is likely to work out better than exciting adventures into the glamorous and dangerous fields of anticipated growth.

In 1973, when Graham last revised The Intelligent Investor, the annual turnover rate on the New York Stock Exchange was 20%, meaning that the typical shareholder held a stock for five years before selling it. By 2002, the turnover rate had hit 105%a holding period of only 11.4 months. Back in 1973, the average mutual fund held on to a stock for nearly three years; by 2002, that ownership period had shrunk to just 10.9 months.

choice is Vanguard REIT Index Fund; other relatively low-cost choices include Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, Columbia Real Estate Equity Fund, and Fidelity Real Estate Investment Fund.11 While a REIT fund is unlikely to be a foolproof inflation-fighter, in the long run it should give you some defense against the erosion of purchasing power without hampering your overall returns. TIPS. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are U.S. government bonds, first issued in 1997, that automatically go up in value when inflation rises. Because the full faith and credit of the United States stands behind them, all Treasury bonds are safe from the risk of default (or nonpayment of interest). But TIPS also guarantee that the value of your investment won’t be eroded by inflation. In one easy package, you insure yourself against financial loss and the loss of purchasing power.12

Either directly or through a fund, TIPS are the ideal substitute for the proportion of your retirement funds you would otherwise keep in cash. Do not trade them: TIPS can be volatile in the short run, so they work best as a permanent, lifelong holding. For most investors, allocating at least 10% of your retirement assets to TIPS is an intelligent way to keep a portion of your money absolutely safeand entirely beyond the reach of the long, invisible claws of inflation.

There is one catch, however. When the value of your TIPS bond rises as inflation heats up, the Internal Revenue Service regards that increase in value as taxable incomeeven though it is purely a paper gain (unless you sold the bond at its newly higher price). Why does this make sense to the IRS? The intelligent investor will remember the wise words of financial analyst Mark Schweber: “The one question never to ask a bureaucrat is ‘Why?’” Because of this exasperating tax complication, TIPS are best suited for a tax-deferred retirement account like an IRA, Keogh, or 401(k), where they will not jack up your taxable income.

Robert Shiller, a finance professor at Yale University, says Graham inspired his valuation approach: Shiller compares the current price of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index against average corporate profits over the past 10 years (after inflation). By scanning the historical record, Shiller has shown that when his ratio goes well above 20, the market usually delivers poor returns afterward; when it drops well below 10, stocks typically produce handsome gains down the road. In early 2003, by Shiller’s math, stocks were priced at about 22.8 times the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the past decadestill in the danger zone, but way down from their demented level of 44.2 times earnings in December 1999.

If you start something and right away feel yourself getting lazy and irritated, first ask yourself: Why am I doing this? If it really is a necessity, ask yourself: What’s behind my reluctance? Fear? Spite? Fatigue? Don’t forge ahead hoping that someone will come along and relieve you of this task you don’t want to do. Or that someone else will suddenly explain why what you’re doing matters. Don’t be the person who says yes with their mouth but no with their actions.

“Here’s a lesson to test your mind’s mettle: take part of a week in which you have only the most meager and cheap food, dress scantly in shabby clothes, and ask yourself if this is really the worst that you feared. It is when times are good that you should gird yourself for tougher times ahead, for when Fortune is kind the soul can build defenses against her ravages. So it is that soldiers practice maneuvers in peacetime, erecting bunkers with no enemies in sight and exhausting themselves under no attack so that when it comes they won’t grow tired.”

The mind of the beginner is empty, free of the habits of the expert, ready to accept, to doubt, and open to all the possibilities. It is the kind of mind which can see things as they are, which step by step and in a flash can realize the original nature of everything.

“Blessed is he who expecteth nothing, for he shall not be disappointed.” Chesterton’s rejoinder? “Blessed is he who expecteth nothing, for he shall enjoy everything.” Chapter 4 General Portfolio Policy: The Defensive Investor The basic characteristics of an investment portfolio are usually determined by the position and characteristics of the owner or owners. At one extreme we have had savings banks, life-insurance companies, and so-called legal trust funds. A generation ago their investments were limited by law in many states to high-grade bonds and, in some cases, high-grade preferred stocks. At the other extreme we have the well-to-do and experienced businessman, who will include any kind of bond or stock in his security list provided he considers it an attractive purchase. It has been an old and sound principle that those who cannot afford to take risks should be content with a relatively low return on their invested funds. From this there has developed the general notion that the rate of return which the investor should aim for is more or less proportionate to the degree of risk he is ready to run. Our view is different. The rate of return sought should be dependent, rather, on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is willing and able to bring to bear on his task. The minimum return goes to our passive investor, who wants both safety and freedom from concern. The maximum return would be realized by the alert and enterprising investor who exercises maximum intelligence and skill.

There is an implication here that the standard division should be an equal one, or 5050, between the two major investment mediums. According to tradition the sound reason for increasing the percentage in common stocks would be the appearance of the “bargain price” levels created in a protracted bear market. Conversely, sound procedure would call for reducing the common-stock component below 50% when in the judgment of the investor the market level has become dangerously high.

It is almost a contradiction in terms to suggest as a feasible policy for the average stockowner that he lighten his holdings when the market advances beyond a certain point and add to them after a corresponding decline.

Nonetheless we are convinced that our 5050 version of this approach makes good sense for the defensive investor. It is extremely simple; it aims unquestionably in the right direction; it gives the follower the feeling that he is at least making some moves in response to market developments; most important of all, it will restrain him from being drawn more and more heavily into common stocks as the market rises to more and more dangerous heights.

The choice of issues in the bond component of the investor’s portfolio will turn about two main questions: Should he buy taxable or tax-free bonds, and should he buy shorter- or longer-termmaturities? The tax decision should be mainly a matter of arithmetic, turning on the difference in yields as compared with the investor’s tax bracket. In January 1972 the choice in 20-year maturities was between obtaining, say, 7½% on “grade Aa” corporate bonds and 5.3% on prime tax-free issues. (The term “municipals” is generally applied to all species of tax-exempt bonds, including state obligations.)

The choice of longer versus shorter maturities involves quite a different question, viz.: Does the investor want to assure himself against a decline in the price of his bonds, but at the cost of (1) a lower annual yield and (2) loss of the possibility of an appreciable gain in principal value? We think it best to discuss this question in Chapter 8,

the right to cash in the bonds at cost price or better has given the purchasers in former years of low interest rates complete protection against the shrinkage in principal value that befell many bond investors; otherwise stated, it gave them the possibility of benefiting from the rise in interest rates by switching their low-interest holdings into very-high-coupon issues on an even-money basis.

Not all tax-free bonds are strongly enough protected to justify their purchase by a defensive investor. He may be guided in his selection by the rating given to each issue by Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s. One of three highest ratings by both servicesAaa (AAA), Aa (AA), or Ashould constitute a sufficient indication of adequate safety. The yield on these bonds will vary both with the quality and the maturity, with the shorter maturities giving the lower return.

In practical terms, we advise the investor in long-term issues to sacrifice a small amount of yield to obtain the assurance of noncallabilitysay for 20 or 25 years. Similarly, there is an advantage in buying a low-coupon bond* at a discount rather than a high-coupon bond selling at about par and callable in a few years. For the discounte.g., of a 3½% bond at 63½%, yielding 7.85%carries full protection against adverse call action.

Certain general observations should be made here on the subject of preferred stocks. Really good preferred stocks can and do exist, but they are good in spite of their investment form, which is an inherently bad one. The typical preferred shareholder is dependent for his safety on the ability and desire of the company to pay dividends on its common stock. Once the common dividends are omitted, or even in danger, his own position becomes precarious, for the directors are under no obligation to continue paying him unless they also pay on the common. On the other hand, the typical preferred stock carries no share in the company’s profits beyond the fixed dividend rate. Thus the preferred holder lacks both the legal claim of the bondholder (or creditor) and the profit possibilities of a common shareholder (or partner).

So when you cook you should express yourself in your activity in the kitchen. You should allow yourself plenty of time; you should work on it with nothing in your mind, and without expecting anything. You should just cook!

Because there is no bridge long enough to go across the gap, he will begin to despair. That is the usual spiritual way. But our spiritual way is not so idealistic. In some sense we should be idealistic; at least we should be interested in making bread which tastes and looks good!

When your diaphragm contracts, it pushes down and two things happen.First, your lungs get pulled down, too, which creates low pre s s u re in them. Fresh air there f o re gets sucked in.Second, your inner organs get pushed down and displaced (unless your abs a re tight). Your belly expands.So, stomach breathing is really diaphragmatic b re a t h i n g .

First, perf o rm the anal lock. Contract your sphincter beforehand and keep your pelvic diaphragm pulled up whenever you have pre s s u re in your abdomen from exertion. The anal lock is the standard operating pro c e d u re in many martial arts. This bizarre technique is vital for health and perf o rm a n c e reasons.Second, pretend that you are straining to have a bowel movement while maintaining the lock. Keep your face impassive. Don’t try too hard the first time; just observe your body. You will notice a compression of your guts and a very powerful, stable feeling in your waist as your diaphragm anchors your torso. Your abdomen will slightly expand and so will your obliques

Otherwise too much of your bond income will end up in the hands of the IRS. The only place to own taxable bonds is inside your 401(k) or another sheltered account, where you will owe no current tax on their incomeand where municipal bonds have no place, since their tax advantage goes to waste.

On the other hand, if interest rates fall, bond prices riseand a long-term bond will outper-forms shorter ones.8 You can split the difference simply by buying intermediate-term bonds maturing in five to 10 yearswhich do not soar when their side of the seesaw rises, but do not slam into the ground either.

Treasury bills mature in four, 13, or 26 weeks. Because of their very short maturities, T-bills barely get dented when rising interest rates knock down the prices of other income investments; longer-term Treasury debt, however, suffers severely when interest rates rise. The interest income on Treasury securities is generally free from state (but not Federal) income tax. And, with $3.7 trillion in public hands, the market for Treasury debt is immense, so you can readily find a buyer if you need your money back before maturity.

But this “I” which is creating and always giving out something is not the “small I”; it is the “big I.” Even though you do not realize the oneness of this “big I” with everything, when you give something you feel good, because at that time you feel at one with what you are giving.

the most practiced Stoics take it a step further. Instead of simply accepting what happens, they urge us to actually enjoy what has happenedwhatever it is. Nietzsche, many centuries later, coined the perfect expression to capture this idea: amor fati (a love of fate). It’s not just accepting, it’s loving everything that happens.

In Hinayana Buddhism, practice is classified in four ways. The best way is just to do it without having any joy in it, not even spiritual joy. This way is just to do it, forgetting your physical and mental feeling, forgetting all about yourself in your practice. This is the fourth stage, or the highest stage. The next highest stage is to have just physical joy in your practice. At this stage you find some pleasure in practice, and you will practice because of the pleasure you find in it. In the second stage you have both mental and physical joy, or good feeling. These two middle stages are stages in which you practice zazen because you feel good in your practice. The first stage is when you have no thinking and no curiosity in your practice.

Annuities. These insurance-like investments enable you to defer current taxes and capture a stream of income after you retire. Fixed annuities offer a set rate of return; variable ones provide a fluctuating return. But what the defensive investor really needs to defend against here are the hard-selling insurance agents, stockbrokers, and financial planners who peddle annuities at rapaciously high costs.

Preferred stock. Preferred shares are a worst-of-both-worlds investment. They are less secure than bonds, since they have only a secondary claim on a company’s assets if it goes bankrupt. And they offer less profit potential than common stocks do, since companies typically “call” (or forcibly buy back) their preferred shares when interest rates drop or their credit rating improves. Unlike the interest payments on most of its bonds, an issuing company cannot deduct preferred dividend payments from its corporate tax bill. Ask yourself: If this company is healthy enough to deserve my investment, why is it paying a fat dividend on its preferred stock instead of issuing bonds and getting a tax break?

The argument we made for common stocks in 1949 turned on two main points. The first was that they had offered a considerable degree of protection against the erosion of the investor’s dollar caused by inflation, whereas bonds offered no protection at all. The second advantage of common stocks lay in their higher average return to investors over the years. This was produced both by an average dividend income exceeding the yield on good bonds and by an underlying tendency for market value to increase over the years in consequence of the reinvestment of undistributed profits. While these two advantages have been of major importanceand have given common stocks a far better record than bonds over the long-term pastwe have consistently warned that these benefits could be lost by the stock buyer if he pays too high a price for his shares.

The problem lies there, of course, since growth stocks have long sold at high prices in relation to current earnings and at much higher multiples of their average profits over a past period. This has introduced a speculative element of considerable weight in the growth-stock picture and has made successful operations in this field a far from simple matter.

Similarly, if a preferred stock or even a common stock is bought with the expectation that a given rate of dividend will be continued, then a reduction or passing of the dividend means that it has proved unsafe.

If a group of well-selected common-stock investments shows a satisfactory overall return, as measured through a fair number of years, then this group investment has proved to be “safe.” During that period its market value is bound to fluctuate, and as likely as not it will sell for a while under the buyer’s cost. If that fact makes the investment “risky,” it would then have to be called both risky and safe at the same time. This confusion may be avoided if we apply the concept of risk solely to a loss of value which either is realized through actual sale, or is caused by a significant deterioration in the company’s positionor, more frequently perhaps, is the result of the payment of an excessive price in relation to the intrinsic worth of the security.

Somewhere in the middle of the bull market the first common-stock flotations make their appearance. These are priced not unattractively, and some large profits are made by the buyers of the early issues. As the market rise continues, this brand of financing grows more frequent; the quality of the companies becomes steadily poorer; the prices asked and obtained verge on the exorbitant. One fairly dependable sign of the approaching end of a bull swing is the fact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies are offered at prices somewhat higher than the current level for many medium-sized companies with a long market history.

Since 1978, an annual average of 4.4% of the junk-bond market has gone into defaultbut, even after those defaults, junk bonds have still produced an annualized return of 10.5%, versus 8.6% for 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds.2 Unfortunately, most junk-bond funds charge high fees and do a poor job of preserving the original principal amount of your investment. A junk fund could be appropriate if you are retired, are looking for extra monthly income to supplement your pension, and can tolerate temporary tumbles in value. If you work at a bank or other financial company, a sharp rise in interest rates could limit your raise or even threaten your job securityso a junk fund, which tends to outper-forms most other bond funds when interest rates rise, might make sense as a counterweight in your 401(k).

But emerging-markets bond funds seldom move in synch with the U.S. stock market, so they are one of the rare investments that are unlikely to drop merely because the Dow is down. That can give you a small corner of comfort in your portfolio just when you may need it most.

your own eagerness to buy or sell a stock can lower your return. Someone who is desperate to buy a stock can easily end up having to bid 10 cents higher than the most recent share price before any sellers will be willing to part with it. That extra cost, called “market impact,” never shows up on your brokerage statement, but it’s real. If you’re overeager to buy 1,000 shares of a stock and you drive its price up by just five cents, you’ve just cost yourself an invisible but very real $50.

When you listen to our teaching with a pure, clear mind, you can accept it as if you were hearing something which you already knew. This is called emptiness, or omnipotent self, or knowing everything. When you know everything, you are like a dark sky. Sometimes a flashing will come through the dark sky. After it passes, you forget all about it, and there is nothing left but the dark sky. The sky is never surprised when all of a sudden a thunderbolt breaks through. And when the lightning does flash, a wonderful sight may be seen. When we have emptiness we are always prepared for watching the flashing.

The usual translation of the Japanese word nin is “patience,” but perhaps “constancy” is a better word. You must force yourself to be patient, but in constancy there is no particular effort involvedthere is only the unchanging ability to accept things as they are. For people who have no idea of emptiness, this ability may appear to be patience, but patience can actually be nonacceptance. People who know, even if only intuitively, the state of emptiness always have open the possibility of accepting things as they are. They can appreciate everything. In everything they do, even though it may be very difficult, they will always be able to dissolve their problems by constancy.

This may be set down as a fundamental law of the stock market, and it suggests an investment approach that should prove both conservative and promising. The key requirement here is that the enterprising investor concentrate on the larger companies that are going through a period of unpopularity. While small companies may also be undervalued for similar reasons, and in many cases may later increase their earnings and share price, they entail the risk of a definitive loss of profitability and also of protracted neglect by the market in spite of better earnings. The large companies thus have a double advantage over the others. First, they have the resources in capital and brain power to carry them through adversity and back to a satisfactory earnings base. Second, the market is likely to respond with reasonable speed to any improvement shown.

But in considering individual companies a special factor of opposite import must sometimes to be taken into account.

A remarkable demonstration of the soundness of this thesis is found in studies of the price behavior of the unpopular issues in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In these it was assumed that an investment was made each year in either the six or the ten issues in the DJIA which were selling at the lowest multipliers of their current or previous year’s earnings. These could be called the “cheapest” stocks in the list, and their cheapness was evidently the reflection of relative unpopularity with investors or traders. It was assumed further that these purchases were sold out at the end of holding periods ranging from one to five years.

There are two tests by which a bargain common stock is detected. The first is by the method of appraisal. This relies largely on estimating future earnings and then multiplying these by a factor appropriate to the particular issue. If the resultant value is sufficiently above the market priceand if the investor has confidence in the technique employedhe can tag the stock as a bargain. The second test is the value of the business to a private owner. This value also is often determined chiefly by expected future earningsin which case the result may be identical with the first. But in the second test more attention is likely to be paid to the realizable value of the assets, with particular emphasis on the net current assets or working capital.

How can we be sure that the currently disappointing results are indeed going to be only temporary? True, we can supply excellent examples of that happening. The steel stocks used to be famous for their cyclical quality, and the shrewd buyer could acquire them at low prices when earnings were low and sell them out in boom years at a fine profit. A spectacular example is supplied by Chrysler Corporation, as shown by the data in Table 7-3. If this were the standard behavior of stocks with fluctuating earnings, then making profits in the stock market would be an easy matter. Unfortunately, we could cite many examples of declines in earnings and price which were not followed automatically by a handsome recovery of both. One such was Anaconda Wire and Cable, which had large earnings up to 1956, with a high price of 85 in that year. The earnings then declined irregularly for six years; the price fell to 23½ in 1962, and the following year it was taken over by its parent enterprise (Anaconda Corporation) at the equivalent of only 33. The many experiences of this type suggest that the investor would need more than a mere falling off in both earnings and price to give him a sound basis for purchase. He should require an indication of at least reasonable stability of earnings over the past decade or morei.e., no year of earnings deficitplus sufficient size and financial strength to meet possible setbacks in the future. The ideal combination here is thus that of a large and prominent company selling both well below its past average price and its past average price/earnings multiplier.

A third cause for an unduly low price for a common stock may be the market’s failure to recognize its true earnings picture. Our classic example here is Northern Pacific Railway which in 194647 declined from 36 to 13½. The true earnings of the road in 1947 were close to $10 per share. The price of the stock was held down in great part by its $1 dividend. It was neglected also because much of its earnings power was concealed by accounting methods peculiar to railroads. The type of bargain issue that can be most readily identified is a common stock that sells for less than the company’s net working capital alone, after deducting all prior obligations.* This would mean that the buyer would pay nothing at all for the fixed assetsbuildings, machinery, etc., or any good-will items that might exist.

The depression years 193132, however, had a particularly devastating impact on the companies below the first rank either in size or in inherent stability. As a result of that experience investors have since developed a pronounced preference for industry leaders and a corresponding lack of interest most of the time in the ordinary company of secondary importance. This has meant that the latter group have usually sold at much lower prices in relation to earnings and assets than have the former. It has meant further that in many instances the price has fallen so low as to establish the issue in the bargain class.

Substantial profits from the purchase of secondary companies at bargain prices arise in a variety of ways. First, the dividend return is relatively high. Second, the reinvested earnings are substantial in relation to the price paid and will ultimately affect the price. In a five-to seven-year period these advantages can bulk quite large in a well-selected list. Third, a bull market is ordinarily most generous to low-priced issues; thus it tends to raise the typical bargain issue to at least a reasonable level. Fourth, even during relatively featureless market periods a continuous process of price adjustment goes on, under which secondary issues that were undervalued may rise at least to the normal level for their type of security. Fifth, the specific factors that in many cases made for a disappointing record of earnings may be corrected by the advent of new conditions, or the adoption of new policies, or by a change in management.

Fourth, even during relatively featureless market periods a continuous process of price adjustment goes on, under which secondary issues that were undervalued may rise at least to the normal level for their type of security. Fifth, the specific factors that in many cases made for a disappointing record of earnings may be corrected by the advent of new conditions, or the adoption of new policies, or by a change in management.

Substantial profits from the purchase of secondary companies at bargain prices arise in a variety of ways. First, the dividend return is relatively high. Second, the reinvested earnings are substantial in relation to the price paid and will ultimately affect the price. In a five-to seven-year period these advantages can bulk quite large in a well-selected list. Third, a bull market is ordinarily most generous to low-priced issues; thus it tends to raise the typical bargain issue to at least a reasonable level. Fourth, even during relatively featureless market periods a continuous process of price adjustment goes on, under which secondary issues that were undervalued may rise at least to the normal level for their type of security. Fifth, the specific factors that in many cases made for a disappointing record of earnings may be corrected by the advent of new conditions, or the adoption of new policies, or by a change in management. An important new factor in recent years has been the acquisition of smaller companies by larger ones, usually as part of a diversification program. In these cases the consideration paid has almost always been relatively generous, and much in excess of the bargain levels existing not long before.

We have advised against the purchase at “full prices” of three important categories of securities: (1) foreign bonds, (2) ordinary preferred stocks, and (3) secondary common stocks, including, of course, original offerings of such issues. By “full prices” we mean prices close to par for bonds or preferred stocks, and prices that represent about the fair business value of the enterprise in the case of common stocks. The greater number of defensive investors are to avoid these categories regardless of price; the enterprising investor is to buy them only when obtainable at bargain priceswhich we define as prices not more than two-thirds of the appraisal value of the securities.

It is a basic characteristic of a primary or leading company that a single detached share is ordinarily worth as much as a share in a controlling block. In secondary companies the average market value of a detached share is substantially less than its worth to a controlling owner.

To see whether a stock is selling for less than the value of net working capital (what Graham’s followers call “net nets”), download or request the most recent quarterly or annual report from the company’s website or from the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. From the company’s current assets, subtract its total liabilities, including any preferred stock and long-term debt. (Or consult your local public library’s copy of the Value Line Investment Survey, saving yourself a costly annual subscription. Each issue carries a list of “Bargain Basement Stocks” that come close to Graham’s definition.)

As of October 31, 2002, for instance, Comverse Technology had $2.4 billion in current assets and $1.0 billion in total liabilities, giving it $1.4 billion in net working capital. With fewer than 190 million shares of stock, and a stock price under $8 per share, Comverse had a total market capitalization of just under $1.4 billion. With the stock priced at no more than the value of Comverse’s cash and inventories, the company’s ongoing business was essentially selling for nothing. As Graham knew, you can still lose money on a stock like Comversewhich is why you should buy them only if you can find a couple dozen at a time and hold them patiently.

If you live in the United States, work in the United States, and get paid in U.S. dollars, you are already making a multilayered bet on the U.S. economy. To be prudent, you should put some of your investment portfolio elsewheresimply because no one, anywhere, can ever know what the future will bring at home or abroad. Putting up to a third of your stock money in mutual funds that hold foreign stocks (including those in emerging markets) helps insure against the risk that our own backyard may not always be the best place in the world to invest.

Usually when you listen to some statement, you hear it as a kind of echo of yourself. You are actually listening to your own opinion. If it agrees with your opinion you may accept it, but if it does not, you will reject it or you may not even really hear it. That is one danger when you listen to someone. The other danger is to be caught by the statement. If you do not understand your master’s statement in its true sense, you will easily be caught by something which is involved in your subjective opinion, or by some particular way the statement is expressed. You will take what he says only as a statement, without understanding the spirit behind the words. This kind of danger is always there.

Do not argue with him; just listen to his objections until he himself finds something wrong with them.” This is very interesting. Try not to force your idea on someone, but rather think about it with him. If you feel you have won the discussion, that also is the wrong attitude.

the intelligent investor should be interested in the possibilities of profiting from these pendulum swings. There are two possible ways by which he may try to do this: the way of timing and the way of pricing. By timing we mean the endeavor to anticipate the action of the stock marketto buy or hold when the future course is deemed to be upward, to sell or refrain from buying when the course is downward. By pricing we mean the endeavor to buy stocks when they are quoted below their fair value and to sell them when they rise above such value. A less ambitious form of pricing is the simple effort to make sure that when you buy you do not pay too much for your stocks. This may suffice for the defensive investor, whose emphasis is on long-pull holding; but as such it represents an essential minimum of attention to market levels.

The investor can scarcely take seriously the innumerable predictions which appear almost daily and are his for the asking. Yet in many cases he pays attention to them and even acts upon them. Why? Because he has been persuaded that it is important for him to form some opinion of the future course of the stock market, and because he feels that the brokerage or service forecast is at least more dependable than his own.

You are richer than you were, good! But has the price risen too high, and should you think of selling? Or should you kick yourself for not having bought more shares when the level was lower? Orworst thought of allshould you now give way to the bull-market atmosphere, become infected with the enthusiasm, the overconfidence and the greed of the great public (of which, after all, you are a part), and make larger and dangerous commitments? Presented thus in print, the answer to the last question is a self-evident no, but even the intelligent investor is likely to need considerable will power to keep from following the crowd.

This really means that, in a very real sense, the better the quality of a common stock, the more speculative it is likely to beat least as compared with the unspectacular middle-grade issues.

A caution is needed here. A stock does not become a sound investment merely because it can be bought at close to its asset value. The investor should demand, in addition, a satisfactory ratio of earnings to price, a sufficiently strong financial position, and the prospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the years. This may appear like demanding a lot from a modestly priced stock, but the prescription is not hard to fill under all but dangerously high market conditions. Once the investor is willing to forgo brilliant prospectsi.e., better than average expected growthhe will have no difficulty in finding a wide selection of issues meeting these criteria.

This price of 70½ was remarkable for the fact it was 30 times the earnings of 1961. Such a price/earnings ratiowhich compares with 23 times for the DJIA in that yearmust have implied expectations of a brilliant growth in earnings. This optimism had no justification in the company’s earnings record in the preceding years, and it proved completely wrong. Instead of advancing rapidly, the course of earnings in the ensuing period was generally downward. The year after the 70½ high the price fell by more than half to 34. But this time the shares did not have the bargain quality that they showed at the low quotation in 1938.

The other is that most businesses change in character and quality over the years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse.

The true investor scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the extent that it suits his book, and no more.* Thus the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That man would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by other persons’ mistakes of judgment.

The most realistic distinction between the investor and the speculator is found in their attitude toward stock-market movements. The speculator’s primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations. The investor’s primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices. Market movements are important to him in a practical sense, because they alternately create low price levels at which he would be wise to buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from buying and probably would be wise to sell.

Note that bond prices do not fluctuate in the same (inverse) proportion as the calculated yields, because their fixed maturity value of 100% exerts a moderating influence. However, for very long maturities, as in our Northern Pacific example, prices and yields change at close to the same rate.

Hence the investor must choose between long-term and short-term bond investments on the basis chiefly of his personal preferences. If he wants to be certain that the market values will not decrease, his best choices are probably U.S. savings bonds, Series E or H, which were described above, p. 93. Either issue will give him a 5% yield (after the first year), the Series E for up to 5 5/6 years, the Series H for up to ten years, with a guaranteed resale value of cost or better.

Mr. Market’s job is to provide you with prices; your job is to decide whether it is to your advantage to act on them. You do not have to trade with him just because he constantly begs you to.

You can’t control whether the stocks or funds you buy will outper-forms the market today, next week, this month, or this year; in the short run, your returns will always be hostage to Mr. Market and his whims. But you can control: your brokerage costs, by trading rarely, patiently, and cheaply your ownership costs, by refusing to buy mutual funds with excessive annual expenses your expectations, by using realism, not fantasy, to forecast your returns7 your risk, by deciding how much of your total assets to put at hazard in the stock market, by diversifying, and by rebalancing your tax bills, by holding stocks for at least one year and, whenever possible, for at least five years, to lower your capital-gains liability and, most of all, your own behavior.

After an event occurs just two or three times in a row, regions of the human brain called the anterior cingulate and nucleus accumbens automatically anticipate that it will happen again. If it does repeat, a natural chemical called dopamine is released, flooding your brain with a soft euphoria. Thus, if a stock goes up a few times in a row, you reflexively expect it to keep goingand your brain chemistry changes as the stock rises, giving you a “natural high.” You effectively become addicted to your own predictions. But when stocks drop, that financial loss fires up your amygdalathe part of the brain that processes fear and anxiety and generates the famous “fight or flight” response that is common to all cornered animals. Just as you can’t keep your heart rate from rising if a fire alarm goes off, just as you can’t avoid flinching if a rattlesnake slithers onto your hiking path, you can’t help feeling fearful when stock prices are plunging.

Although Graham teaches that you should buy when Mr. Market is yelling “sell,” there’s one exception the intelligent investor needs to understand. Selling into a bear market can make sense if it creates a tax windfall. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows you to use your realized losses (any declines in value that you lock in by selling your shares) to offset up to $3,000 in ordinary income.12 Let’s say you bought 200 shares of Coca-Cola stock in January 2000 for $60 a sharea total investment of $12,000. By year-end 2002, the stock was down to $44 a share, or $8,800 for your lota loss of $3,200. You could have done what most people doeither whine about your loss, or sweep it under the rug and pretend it never happened. Or you could have taken control. Before 2002 ended, you could have sold all your Coke shares, locking in the $3,200 loss. Then, after waiting 31 days to comply with IRS rules, you would buy 200 shares of Coke all over again. The result: You would be able to reduce your taxable income by $3,000 in 2002, and you could use the remaining $200 loss to offset your income in 2003. And better yet, you would still own a company whose future you believe inbut now you would own it for almost one-third less than you paid the first time.

But mutual funds aren’t perfect; they are almost perfect, and that word makes all the difference. Because of their imperfections, most funds underperform the market, overcharge their investors, create tax headaches, and suffer erratic swings in performance.

And it’s a reminder that buying funds based purely on their past performance is one of the stupidest things an investor can do. Financial scholars have been studying mutual-fund performance for at least a half century, and they are virtually unanimous on several points: the average fund does not pick stocks well enough to overcome its costs of researching and trading them; the higher a fund’s expenses, the lower its returns; the more frequently a fund trades its stocks, the less it tends to earn; highly volatile funds, which bounce up and down more than average, are likely to stay volatile; funds with high past returns are unlikely to remain winners for long.

First of all, recognize that an index fundwhich owns all the stocks in the market, all the time, without any pretense of being able to select the “best” and avoid the “worst”will beat most funds over the long run. (If your company doesn’t offer a low-cost index fund in your 401(k), organize your coworkers and petition to have one added.) Its rock-bottom overheadoperating expenses of 0.2% annually, and yearly trading costs of just 0.1%give the index fund an insurmountable advantage. If stocks generate, say, a 7% annualized return over the next 20 years, a low-cost index fund like Vanguard Total Stock Market will return just under 6.7%.

They are cheap. One of the most common myths in the fund business is that “you get what you pay for”that high returns are the best justification for higher fees. There are two problems with this argument. First, it isn’t true; decades of research have proven that funds with higher fees earn lower returns over time. Secondly, high returns are temporary, while high fees are nearly as permanent as granite.

The now-standard procedure for estimating future earning power starts with average past data for physical volume, prices received, and operating margin. Future sales in dollars are then projected on the basis of assumptions as to the amount of change in volume and price level over the previous base. These estimates, in turn, are grounded first on general economic forecasts of gross national product, and then on special calculations applicable to the industry and company in question.

Our study of the various methods has led us to suggest a foreshortened and quite simple formula for the valuation of growth stocks, which is intended to produce figures fairly close to those resulting from the more refined mathematical calculations.

Start by reading the statement of cash flows in the company’s annual report. See whether cash from operations has grown steadily throughout the past 10 years. Then you can go further. Warren Buffett has popularized the concept of owner earnings, or net income plus amortization and depreciation, minus normal capital expenditures. As portfolio manager Christopher Davis of Davis Selected Advisors puts it, “If you owned 100% of this business, how much cash would you have in your pocket at the end of the year?” Because it adjusts for accounting entries like amortization and depreciation that do not affect the company’s cash balances, owner earnings can be a better measure than reported net income. To fine-tune the definition of owner earnings, you should also subtract from reported net income: any costs of granting stock options, which divert earnings away from existing shareholders into the hands of new inside owners any “unusual,” “nonrecurring,” or “extraordinary” charges any “income” from the company’s pension fund.

If owner earnings per share have grown at a steady average of at least 6% or 7% over the past 10 years, the company is a stable generator of cash, and its prospects for growth are good.

Look in the annual report for the exhibit or statement showing the “ratio of earnings to fixed charges.” That exhibit to Amazon.com’s 2002 annual report shows that Amazon’s earnings fell $145 million short of covering its interest costs. In the future, Amazon will either have to earn much more from its operations or find a way to borrow money at lower rates.

it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by lifedaily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.

This uniqueness and singleness which distinguishes each individual and gives a meaning to his existence has a bearing on creative work as much as it does on human love. When the impossibility of replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in all its magnitude. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the “why” for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any “how.”

Fourth, it must be stated that even among the guards there were some who took pity on us. I shall only mention the commander of the camp from which I was liberated. It was found after the liberationonly the camp doctor, a prisoner himself, had known of it previouslythat this man had paid no small sum of money from his own pocket in order to purchase medicines for his prisoners from the nearest market town.1 But the senior camp warden, a prisoner himself, was harder than any of the SS guards. He beat the other prisoners at every slightest opportunity, while the camp commander, to my knowledge, never once lifted his hand against any of us.

Logotherapy focuses rather on the future, that is to say, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future. (Logotherapy, indeed, is a meaning-centered psychotherapy.) At the same time, logotherapy defocuses all the vicious-circle formations and feedback mechanisms which play such a great role in the development of neuroses. Thus, the typical self-centeredness of the neurotic is broken up instead of being continually fostered and reinforced.

We’re much better than chance at correctly identifying the students who are telling the truth. But we’re much worse than chance at correctly identifying the students who are lying.

To snap out of truth-default mode requires what Levine calls a “trigger.” A trigger is not the same as a suspicion, or the first sliver of doubt. We fall out of truth-default mode only when the case against our initial assumption becomes definitive. We do not behave, in other words, like sober-minded scientists, slowly gathering evidence of the truth or falsity of something before reaching a conclusion. We do the opposite. We start by believing. And we stop believing only when our doubts and misgivings rise to the point where we can no longer explain them away.

In real life, Tim Levine reminds us, lies are rare. And those lies that are told are told by a very small subset of people. That’s why it doesn’t matter so much that we are terrible at detecting lies in real life. Under the circumstances, in fact, defaulting to truth makes logical sense. If the person behind the counter at the coffee shop says your total with tax is $6.74, you can do the math yourself to double-check their calculations, holding up the line and wasting thirty seconds of your time. Or you can simply assume the salesperson is telling you the truth, because on balance most people do tell the truth.

Folk psychology is the kind of crude psychology we glean from cultural sources such as sitcoms. But that is not the way things happen in real life. Transparency is a mythan idea we’ve picked up from watching too much television and reading too many novels where the hero’s “jaw dropped with astonishment” or “eyes went wide with surprise.” Schützwohl went on: “The participants apparently reasoned that, since they felt surprised, and since surprise is associated with a characteristic facial display, they must have shown this display.

The myopia theory was first suggested by psychologists Claude Steele and Robert Josephs, and what they meant by myopia is that alcohol’s principal effect is to narrow our emotional and mental fields of vision. It creates, in their words, “a state of shortsightedness in which superficially understood, immediate aspects of experience have a disproportionate influence on behavior and emotion.” Alcohol makes the thing in the foreground even more salient and the thing in the background less significant. It makes short-term considerations loom large, and more cognitively demanding, longer-term considerations fade away.

Sometimes alcohol cheers us up. But at other times, when an anxious person drinks they just get more anxious. Myopia theory has an answer to that puzzle: it depends on what the anxious, drunk person is doing. If he’s at a football game surrounded by rabid fans, the excitement and drama going on around him will temporarily crowd out his pressing worldly concerns. The game is front and center. His worries are not. But if the same man is in a quiet corner of a bar, drinking alone, he will get more depressed. Now there’s nothing to distract him. Drinking puts you at the mercy of your environment. It crowds out everything except the most immediate experiences.

When you are drunk, your understanding of your true self changes. This is the crucial implication of drunkenness as myopia. The old disinhibition idea implied that what was revealed when someone got drunk was a kind of stripped-down, distilled version of their sober selfwithout any of the muddying effects of social nicety and propriety. You got the real you. As the ancient saying goes, In vino veritas: “In wine there is truth.” But that’s backward. The kinds of conflicts that normally keep our impulses in check are a crucial part of how we form our character. All of us construct our personality by managing the conflict between immediate, near considerations and more complicated, longer-term considerations. That is what it means to be ethical or productive or responsible. The good parent is someone who is willing to temper their own immediate selfish needs (to be left alone, to be allowed to sleep) with longer-term goals (to raise a good child). When alcohol peels away those longer-term constraints on our behavior, it obliterates our true self.

So on the weekends, they used the transformative power of alcohol to create the “communal expression” so sorely lacking from Monday to Friday. They used the myopia of alcohol to temporarily create a different world for themselves. They gave themselves strict rules: one bottle at a time, an organized series of toasts, all seated around the circle, only on the weekends, never alone. They drank only within a structure, and the structure of those drinking circles in the Bolivian interior was a world of soft music and quiet conversation: order, friendship, predictability, and ritual. This was a new Camba society, manufactured with the assistance of one of the most powerful drugs on earth.

What happens to us when we get drunk is a function of the particular path the alcohol takes as it seeps through our brain tissue. The effects begin in the frontal lobes, the part of our brain behind our forehead that governs attention, motivation, planning, and learning. The first drink “dampens” activity in that region. It makes us a little dumber, less capable of handling competing complicated considerations. It hits the reward centers of the brain, the areas that govern euphoria, and gives them a little jolt. It finds its way into the amygdala. The amygdala’s job is to tell us how to react to the world around us. Are we being threatened? Should we be afraid? Alcohol turns the amygdala down a notch. The combination of those three effects is where myopia comes from. We don’t have the brainpower to handle more complex, long-term considerations. We’re distracted by the unexpected pleasure of the alcohol. Our neurological burglar alarm is turned off. We become altered versions of ourselves, beholden to the moment. Alcohol also finds its way to your cerebellum, at the very back of the brain, which is involved in balance and coordination.

That’s the way blackouts work. At or around the 0.15 mark, the hippocampus shuts down and memories stop forming, but it is entirely possible that the frontal lobes, cerebellum, and amygdala of that same drinkerat the same timecan continue to function more or less normally.

If an American male of average weight has eight drinks over four hourswhich would make him a moderate drinker at a typical frat partyhe would end up with a blood-alcohol reading of 0.107. That’s too drunk to drive, but well below the 0.15 level typically associated with blackouts. If a woman of average weight has eight drinks over four hours, by contrast, she’s at a blood-alcohol level of 0.173. She’s blacked out.

Having a meal in your stomach when you drink reduces your peak BAC [blood-alcohol concentration] by about a third. In other words, if you drink on an empty stomach you’re going to reach a much higher BAC and you’re going to do it much more quickly, and if you’re drinking spirits and wine while you’re drinking on an empty stomach, again higher BAC much more quickly. And if you’re a woman, less body water [yields] higher BAC much more quickly.

And KSM was a hard-core guy. Mitchell and Jessen could use only walling and sleep deprivation to get him to talk because, incredibly, waterboarding did not work on him. Somehow KSM was able to open his sinuses, and the water that flowed into his nose would simply flow out his mouth. No one understood how he did it. Mitchell calls it a magic trick. After a few sessions, KSM grasped the cadence of the pours. He would mock the room by counting down the remaining seconds on his fingersthen making a slashing gesture with his hand when it was over.

The “truth” about Amanda Knox or Jerry Sandusky or KSM is not some hard and shiny object that can be extracted if only we dig deep enough and look hard enough. The thing we want to learn about a stranger is fragile. If we tread carelessly, it will crumple under our feet. And from that follows a second cautionary note: we need to accept that the search to understand a stranger has real limits. We will never know the whole truth.

from time to time, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) conducts audits at different airports. They slip a gun or a fake bomb into a piece of luggage. What do they find? That 95 percent of the time, the guns and bombs go undetected. This is not because airport screeners are lazy or incompetent. Rather, it is because the haystack search represents a direct challenge to the human tendency to default to truth. The airport screener sees something, and maybe it looks a little suspicious. But she looks up at the line of very ordinary-looking travelers waiting patiently, and she remembers that in two years on the job she’s never seen a real gun. She knows, in fact, that in a typical year the TSA screens 1.7 billion carry-on bags, and out of that number finds only a few thousand handguns. That’s a hit rate of .0001 percentwhich means the odds are that if she kept doing her job for another 50 years she would never see a gun.

We all have our own constraints to deal withrules and social norms we’re required to observe that we’d rather not. Dress codes, protocols, procedures, legal obligations, and company hierarchies that are all telling us how we have to behave. Think about it too much and it can start to feel oppressive, even suffocating. If we’re not careful, this is likely to throw us off our game. Instead of giving in to frustration, we can put it to good use. It can power our actions, which, unlike our disposition, become stronger and better when loose and bold. While others obsess with observing the rules, we’re subtly undermining them and subverting them to our advantage. Think water. When dammed by a man-made obstacle, it does not simply sit stagnant. Instead, its energy is stored and deployed, fueling the power plants that run entire cities.

Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill. It is only thus that we evoke his will to meaning from its state of latency. I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology, “homeostasis,” i.e., a tensionless state.

The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. Now we can understand Schopenhauer when he said that mankind was apparently doomed to vacillate eternally between the two extremes of distress and boredom. In actual fact, boredom is now causing, and certainly bringing to psychiatrists, more problems to solve than distress. And these problems are growing increasingly crucial, for progressive automation will probably lead to an enormous increase in the leisure hours available to the average worker. The pity of it is that many of these will not know what to do with all their newly acquired free time.

Too often people think that will is how bad we want something. In actuality, the will has a lot more to do with surrender than with strength. Try “God willing” over “the will to win” or “willing it into existence,” for even those attributes can be broken. True will is quiet humility, resilience, and flexibility; the other kind of will is weakness disguised by bluster and ambition. See which lasts longer under the hardest of obstacles.

Or that some intersection is blocked or that a particular road has been rerouted through an inconvenient detour. We can’t argue or yell this problem away. We simply accept it. That is not to say we allow it to prevent us from reaching our ultimate destination. But it does change the way we travel to get there and the duration of the trip.

You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends. But you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted and you will get good assignments.” Then Boyd paused, to make the alternative clear. “Or,” he said, “you can go that way and you can do somethingsomething for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself. If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won’t have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference. To be somebody or to do something.

If your purpose is something larger than youto accomplish something, to prove something to yourselfthen suddenly everything becomes both easier and more difficult. Easier in the sense that you know now what it is you need to do and what is important to you. The other “choices” wash away, as they aren’t really choices at all. They’re distractions. It’s about the doing, not the recognition. Easier in the sense that you don’t need to compromise. Harder because each opportunityno matter how gratifying or rewardingmust be evaluated along strict guidelines: Does this help me do what I have set out to do?

As the psychologist David Elkind has famously researched, adolescence is marked by a phenomenon known now as the “imaginary audience.” Consider a thirteen-year-old so embarrassed that he misses a week of class, positive that the entire school is thinking and murmuring about some tiny incident that in truth hardly anyone noticed. Or a teenage girl who spends three hours in front of the mirror each morning, as if she’s about to go on stage. They do this because they’re convinced that their every move is being watched with rapt attention by the rest of the world.

If success is ego intoxication, then failure can be a devastating ego blowturning slips into falls and little troubles into great unravelings. If ego is often just a nasty side effect of great success, it can be fatal during failure. We have many names for these problems: Sabotage. Unfairness. Adversity. Trials. Tragedy. No matter the label, it’s a trial. We don’t like it, and some of us are sunk by it. Others seem to be built to make it through. In either case, it’s a trial each person must endure.

Ego loves this notion, the idea that something is “fair” or not. Psychologists call it narcissistic injury when we take personally totally indifferent and objective events. We do that when our sense of self is fragile and dependent on life going our way all the time.

People make mistakes all the time. They start companies they think they can manage. They have grand and bold visions that were a little too grandiose. This is all perfectly fine; it’s what being an entrepreneur or a creative or even a business executive is about. We take risks. We mess up. The problem is that when we get our identity tied up in our work, we worry that any kind of failure will then say something bad about us as a person. It’s a fear of taking responsibility, of admitting that we might have messed up. It’s the sunk cost fallacy. And so we throw good money and good life after bad and end up making everything so much worse.

When the Europeans collected boys for the mission school years ago, most elders gave them the ones they wanted to get rid of, the layabouts and malcontents.

Before a culture adopts the use of writing, when its knowledge is transmitted exclusively through oral means, it can very easily revise its history. It’s not intentional, but it is inevitable; throughout the world, bards and griots have adapted their material to their audiences and thus gradually adjusted the past to suit the needs of the present. The idea that accounts of the past shouldn’t change is a product of literate cultures’ reverence for the written word. Anthropologists will tell you that oral cultures understand the past differently; for them, their histories don’t need to be accurate so much as they need to validate the community’s understanding of itself. So it wouldn’t be correct to say that their histories are unreliable; their histories do what they need to do. Right now each of us is a private oral culture. We rewrite our pasts to suit our needs and support the story we tell about ourselves.

The universe is so vast that intelligent life must surely have arisen many times. The universe is also so old that even one technological species would have had time to expand and fill the galaxy. Yet there is no sign of life anywhere except on Earth. Humans call this the Fermi Paradox. One proposed solution to the Fermi Paradox is that intelligent species actively try to conceal their presence, to avoid being targeted by hostile invaders. Speaking as a member of a species that has been driven nearly to extinction by humans, I can attest that this is a wise strategy.

On the other hand, if what you’re producing is mediocre, then you’re in trouble, as it’s too easy for your audience to find a better alternative online.

As the journalist Daniel Coyle surveys in his 2009 book, The Talent Code, these scientists increasingly believe the answer includes myelina layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner. To understand the role of myelin in improvement, keep in mind that skills, be they intellectual or physical, eventually reduce down to brain circuits. This new science of performance argues that you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively.
==========

By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuitseffectively cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination. By contrast, if you’re trying to learn a complex new skill (say, SQL database management) in a state of low concentration (perhaps you also have your Facebook feed open), you’re firing too many circuits simultaneously and haphazardly to isolate the group of neurons you actually want to strengthen.

Leroy introduced an effect she called attention residue. In the introduction to this paper, she noted that other researchers have studied the effect of multitaskingtrying to accomplish multiple tasks simultaneouslyon performance, but that in the modern knowledge work office, once you got to a high enough level, it was more common to find people working on multiple projects sequentially: “Going from one meeting to the next, starting to work on one project and soon after having to transition to another is just part of life in organizations,” Leroy explains. The problem this research identifies with this work strategy is that when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, your attention doesn’t immediately followa residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. This residue gets especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, but even if you finish Task A before moving on, your attention remains divided for a while.

It might seem harmless to take a quick glance at your inbox every ten minutes or so. Indeed, many justify this behavior as better than the old practice of leaving an inbox open on the screen at all times (a straw-man habit that few follow anymore). But Leroy teaches us that this is not in fact much of an improvement. That quick check introduces a new target for your attention. Even worse, by seeing messages that you cannot deal with at the moment (which is almost always the case), you’ll be forced to turn back to the primary task with a secondary task left unfinished. The attention residue left by such unresolved switches dampens your performance.

Among many breakthroughs, Csikszentmihalyi’s work with ESM helped validate a theory he had been developing over the preceding decade: “The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.”

Csikszentmihalyi calls this mental state flow (a term he popularized with a 1990 book of the same title). At the time, this finding pushed back against conventional wisdom. Most people assumed (and still do) that relaxation makes them happy. We want to work less and spend more time in the hammock. But the results from Csikszentmihalyi’s ESM studies reveal that most people have this wrong: Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

From Descartes’s skepticism came the radical belief that the individual seeking certainty trumped a God or king bestowing truth. The resulting Enlightenment, of course, led to the concept of human rights and freed many from oppression. But as Dreyfus and Kelly emphasize, for all its good in the political arena, in the domain of the metaphysical this thinking stripped the world of the order and sacredness essential to creating meaning.

“The woodworker has an intimate relationship with the wood he works. Its subtle virtues call out to be cultivated and cared for.” In this appreciation for the “subtle virtues” of his medium, they note, the craftsman has stumbled onto something crucial in a post-Enlightenment world: a source of meaning sited outside the individual. The wheelwright doesn’t decide arbitrarily which virtues of the wood he works are valuable and which are not; this value is inherent in the wood and the task it’s meant to perform.

Throughout most of human history, to be a blacksmith or a wheelwright wasn’t glamorous. But this doesn’t matter, as the specifics of the work are irrelevant. The meaning uncovered by such efforts is due to the skill and appreciation inherent in craftsmanshipnot the outcomes of their work. Put another way, a wooden wheel is not noble, but its shaping can be. The same applies to knowledge work. You don’t need a rarified job; you need instead a rarified approach to your work.

Anything that’s truly urgent she’ll bring to Knuth promptly, and everything else he’ll handle in a big batch, once every three months or so.

Perhaps the biggest obstacle to implementing this philosophy is that even short periods of deep work require a flexibility that many fear they lack in their current positions.

The rhythmic philosophy provides an interesting contrast to the bimodal philosophy. It perhaps fails to achieve the most intense levels of deep thinking sought in the daylong concentration sessions favored by the bimodalist. The trade-off, however, is that this approach works better with the reality of human nature. By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year.
